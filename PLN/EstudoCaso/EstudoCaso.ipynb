       "  'The Mayor of London (\"the Mayor\") challenges by statutory review under s.288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (\"TCPA 1990\") two decisions of the First Defendant, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government (\"the Secretary of State\") issued on 31 October 2019: (a) allowing the appeal of the Second Defendant (\"the School\") against a refusal of planning permission by the local planning authority, the London Borough of Harrow (\"LBH\") on the direction of the Mayor and (b) ordering the Mayor to pay to the School its costs of the inquiry proceedings (pursuant to s.250(5) of the Local Government Act 1972 and ss.78 and 320 pf TCPA 1990). The proposal related to substantial development at Harrow School.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"The School is located on the slopes and on the crest of the settlement of Harrow-on-the-Hill. The School's estate occupies a substantial part of Harrow Hill, about 122 ha. The School's buildings are set within relatively open areas and landscaped grounds. They comprise buildings from different eras, but in the main the architecture is Victorian and Twentieth Century. The concentration of buildings becomes more dense towards the crest of the hill. A number of listed and non-listed school and other buildings occupy the hill to the north and west of the appeal site. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The appeal site, 4.7 ha in area, lies on the eastern side of the hill on its lower slopes. It contains the existing sports building (footprint 1,515 sqm and floorspace 3,095 sqm), a science building, office accommodation, a sports pavilion and grassed areas. The levels drop across the site from west to east, representing a step incline of 1 in 7, and a vertical difference of about 36m.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"To the east of the appeal site there are outdoor sports facilities. To the south lies Harrow Park, which contains the School's golf course. These areas form part of a Registered Historic Park and Garden and the Harrow Park Conservation Area. To the west, north and north-west of the appeal site lies the Harrow School Conservation Area.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In summary, the proposed development comprises the demolition of a number of buildings within the appeal site, including the existing sports building, and the construction of a new sports building (footprint 4,923 sqm and floor area 7,269 sqm on 3 levels) and a new science building (floor area 3,675 sqm on 3 levels), a new landscaping core, new visitor car parking and various alterations to and relocations of facilities.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The eastern part of the appeal site and the surrounding open land to the east and south is designated Metropolitan Open Land (\"MOL\"), to which Green Belt development control policies are applicable. The new sports building is proposed to be cut into the slope of the Hill. It would lie within the MOL. The science building proposed to be located just to the west would lie outside that designation.\\r',\n",

       "  'The only part of the proposal to which the Mayor objected was the sports building.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In his report to the Secretary of State the Inspector identified a number of heritage assets affected by the proposal. They comprised listed buildings: St Mary's Church, the Vaughan Library, the Chapel, New Schools, the Butler Building, and the Music Building; the Harrow School Conservation Area; and the Harrow Park Registered Park and Garden and Conservation Area (IR 69). The only element of the proposal which was said to be harmful to the setting or to the character and appearance of these assets was the proposed sports building.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Inspector identified what he considered to be the main issues in the appeal. It is important to note that he had previously set these out for the parties in his \"pre-inquiry note\" and repeated them orally at the beginning of the inquiry. He recorded that the main parties agreed that these were \"the salient main matters in dispute\". The Mayor confirmed that he does not challenge IR 3 which defined the main issues as follows: -\\r',\n",

       "  '(iii) Whether the proposed development would preserve the setting of nearby designated heritage assets, and preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Harrow School Conservation Area, and if not whether any public benefits would outweigh any harm, and; ',\n",
       "  '(iv) If the proposal is inappropriate development, whether the harm by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations, so as to amount to the very special circumstances required to justify it\" (emphasis added).',\n",
       "  '\\tIt is significant that in issue (iv) the Inspector correctly described the planning balance which had to be struck when applying MOL policy.',\n",
       "  \"However, a good deal of the Mayor's challenge to the decision on the planning appeal related to a part of his case at the inquiry which had raised a subject falling outside those main issues, namely whether the proposal would cause harm to heritage assets and thereby harm to one of the purposes of the MOL.\\r\",\n",

The LP is that strategy. The statutory scheme requires the plan to include the Mayor\\'s \"policies\" for the development and use of land in Greater London and a \"reasoned justification\" for the strategy. That reasoned justification is relevant to the interpretation of the policy, but is not itself policy. It does not therefore have the force of policy, nor can it \"trump policy\". Accordingly, as Mr. Edwards QC pointed out for the Mayor, a development proposal cannot be said to fail to accord with the development plan simply because it breached a criterion contained solely in the reasoned justification (R (Cherkley Campaign Limited) v Mole Valley District Council [2014] EWCA Civ 567 at [16]).\\r',\n",

       "  'Planning decisions',\n",
       "  \"B.\\tThe strongest protection should be given to London's Metropolitan Open Land and inappropriate development refused, except in very special circumstances, giving the same level of protection as in the Green Belt. Essential ancillary facilities for appropriate uses will only be acceptable where they maintain the openness of MOL.\",\n",
       "  'LDF preparation',\n",
       "  'C.\\tAny alterations to the boundary of MOL should be undertaken by Boroughs through the LDF process, in consultation with the Mayor and adjoining authorities.',\n",
       "  'D.\\tTo designate land as MOL boroughs need to establish that the land meets at least one of the following criteria:',\n",
       "  'a.\\tit contributes to the physical structure of London by being clearly distinguishable from the built up area',\n",

       "  'd.\\tit forms part of a Green Chain or a link in the network of green infrastructure and meets one of the above criteria.\"',\n",
       "  'Thus, the strategic policy in 7.17A protects the MOL against development having an adverse impact on its openness. Policy 7.17B gives the same level of protection to the MOL as land in the Green Belt, by requiring that \"inappropriate development\" in the MOL should be refused except in \"very special circumstances\" (\"VSC\"). \"Inappropriate development\" and VSC are both terms of art used in Green Belt policy. They are not defined in the LP. Not surprisingly therefore, paragraph 7.56 of the reasoned justification states that \"the policy guidance of paragraphs 79-92 of the NPPF applies equally to MOL\" (emphasis added). That reference to the 2012 version of the National Planning Policy Framework (\"NPPF\") now translates to paragraphs 133 to 147 of the 2019 edition (see paragraphs 20 to 22 below).\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The policy in the London Plan therefore depends upon the NPPF for the definition of inappropriate development (paragraphs 145 to 147 of the 2019 edition) and for development control policy (paragraphs 143 to 144).\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'When designating an area as MOL, policy 7.17D requires that that land should meet at least one of the 4 criteria there set out. These are referred to as \"MOL purposes\". The policy recognises that land included in the MOL may not serve all of those potential purposes. But the Mayor contends that MOL purposes do not go beyond those 4 criteria. However, paragraph 7.56 makes it plain that Green Belt purposes, as set out in paragraphs 133-4 of the NPPF are also relevant, although plainly, an area of MOL may not serve all or any of those additional purposes. Whether it does so will depend on the circumstances of each case. Once the relevant MOL/Green Belt purposes served by a particular area of MOL have been identified, harm that a proposal would cause to one of more of those purposes is a material consideration in the application of development control policy for MOL, along with harm by reason of development being inappropriate and any harm to openness, just as it is for Green Belt (Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council  Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions [2002] JPL 1509 at [67]).

The Inspector addressed community need and uses of the sports building at IR 102-105. The proposal would provide 22,000 hours a year of community use. He described this benefit as \"having very substantial weight\". IR 107-113 dealt with the provision of 1,300 hours a year of free access to state maintained local schools and a further 400 hours a year at substantially discounted rates to community groups proposed by LBH. The Inspector considered this \"to be a manifest benefit which should be afforded significant weight\". At IR 114 the Inspector repeated his earlier conclusion that the MOL land swap should be given no more than \"minimal weight\". At IR 115-119 the Inspector returned to the subject of alternative sites and concluded that \"the lack of realistic and feasible alternative locations to deliver the identified sports and science need of Harrow School weighed significantly in favour of proposal.\" The Inspector addressed compliance with the SPD at IR 120-125. He praised the SPD as a masterplan for the future development of the School over a period of 20 years or more, a clear result of the LPA engaging with the School, the local community and other bodies. He found that the locations proposed for the new science building and new sports building accorded with the SPD and that \"the compliance with the Council\\'s site-specific adopted SPD should be afforded substantial weight\". The Inspector dealt with heritage benefits at IR 126-128. They included the \"opening up of views of the historic ridge and out over Greater London\" and \"the demolition of the existing sports buildings with the area returned to open landscaping to enhance the setting of the Grade II listed Music Schools and setting of the conservation area.\"  He concluded that the heritage benefits should be afforded \"modest weight in favour of the proposal.\" At IR 129-132 the Inspector addressed landscaping benefits and concluded they should be given \"moderate weight\". In IR 133-136 the Inspector considered that the net biodiversity gains of the proposal should be given \"substantial weight\".

In addition, the Inspector concluded that the proposal would not result in any other harm, in particular harm to heritage assets. He then concluded that the benefits of the proposal he had identified clearly outweighed the harm to the MOL. At IR 146-150 the Inspector explained why, applying s. 38(6) of PCPA 2004, he considered the proposal to accord with the development plan for the area read as a whole and that there were no material considerations which indicated that a decision should be made otherwise than in accordance with that plan.\\r',\n",

The Secretary of State agreed with the Inspector\\'s conclusion at IR 103 that the proposed agreement providing for community use of the sports building represented a significant public benefit.

       "  'First, I accept the submissions of Mr. Turney on behalf of the Secretary of State that the \"harm to MOL purposes\" point was not developed by the Mayor to any meaningful extent. The subject was not raised in the directed reason for refusal or in the stage 1 or stage 2 reports, or in the Mayor\\'s Statement of Case for the inquiry. It first appeared in paragraph 5.1.7 of the SOCG. The only harm resulting from the sports building which was expressly identified in that paragraph was \"harm through inappropriateness\" and \"harm to the openness of MOL by means of its siting, footprint, and scale.\" The SOCG simply referred to harm \"to MOL purposes\" without more. Certainly, on one reading the harm which was expressly mentioned was sufficient to explain  the reference to harm to MOL purposes. The SOCG also stated that \"substantial weight\" should be given to \"such harm\", but that was referable to all of the harm previously mentioned and not specifically to the \"MOL purposes\" aspect. This is a significant point because there is no complaint about the way in which the Inspector and the Secretary of State dealt with \"harm through inappropriateness\" or \"harm to the openness of the MOL.\" On any fair reading of paragraph 5.1.7 of the SOCG, \"harm to MOL purposes\" was not given any prominence or treated as a point adding anything of substance to the harm that was expressly identified. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'This is also borne out by the superficial treatment of the subject in the proofs of evidence on behalf of the Mayor. The four page planning assessment given by the planning witness contained sparse references such as harm \"to MOL, its openness and purposes.\" Nothing specific was said about any such purpose or purposes.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Paragraph 3.29 of the landscape proof by Mr. Wright paraphrased the purposes stated in Policy 7.17D of the LP. The proof did not suggest that the MOL area to be developed is currently \"accessible to the public\" (Mr. Wright\\'s paraphrase of 7.17D(b)). Other evidence on MOL purposes focused on \"openness\" and \"green infrastructure\", about which no complaint is made. Instead, the scope of this challenge was restricted to heritage value, arising from Mr. Wright\\'s paraphrase of 7.17D(c) as \"localities which offer sporting, leisure, heritage and biodiversity value \\x85.\". But that attracted only the following brief comments in table 3 of Mr. Wright\\'s proof:-\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"Whilst heritage matters are dealt with in detail in Mr Nigel Barker Mills\\' proof, I consider that the harm to the traditional settlement pattern, associated within the Harrow School Conservation Area, will reduce the public\\'s appreciation of this culturally significant location within the Borough of Harrow, which perceived from the wider MOL setting of the School\\'s recreation grounds\"',\n",

It was accepted by Mr. Edwards QC that the School\\'s case was that the proposal would not harm heritage assets at all. It is not surprising, therefore, that the only harm explicitly identified in paragraphs 5.1.7 of the SOCG was \"harm through inappropriateness\" and \"harm to openness\" and that the reference to \"MOL purposes\" was not further explained. It has not been shown that harm to MOL purposes was raised as a substantial matter in the appeal over and above harm to the MOL through the inappropriateness of development and harm to openness.\\r',\n",

That is plain from the closing submissions made to the Inspector. Paragraph 20 of the Mayor's submissions record that the School's planning consultant, Mr. Paterson, had accepted in cross-examination that the SOCG referred to harm to the purpose in policy 7.17D(c) of the LP, namely harm to a landscape of national or metropolitan value and to the setting of the hilltop settlement on Harrow Hill. But then paragraph 21 recorded that the same witness resiled from that position. The matter is further explained in paragraphs 73 to 77 of the School's submissions. Mr. Paterson believed that the discussions with GLA officers on the drafting of the SOCG were confined to impact on openness, and that was what paragraph 5.1.7 was dealing with. The School added that even if policy 7.17D(c) of the LP or paragraph 134(d) of the NPPF were thought to be relevant, there would be no harm to heritage matters (paragraphs 75 to 77 of its closing submissions).\\r\",\n",

It had therefore resiled from what the Mayor's team thought the agreement with the School to be. The Inspector's conclusion that there was no harm to any heritage purpose of this part of the MOL (IR 67-8) fell squarely within the scope of the issue which the School's case at the inquiry had opened up. \\r\",\n",

I also accept Mr. Turney's submission that the Mayor has failed to set out in any witness statement even the gist of the evidence that he would have called and has been unable to call. This point was raised fairly and squarely in paragraph 44 of the School's Summary Grounds of Defence and has not been refuted.

There is no positive indication in the decision letter that he left \"other harm\", namely heritage harm, out of account. The drafting of the decision letter is no more to be criticised in this respect than sections 5 and 6 of the SOCG, which did not explicitly refer to heritage harm as \"other harm\" for the purposes of the VSC balance.

I agree with Mr. Edwards QC that that was incorrect (see Redhill). But that error should not be read across to the decision on the planning appeal. First, that reasoning was gratuitous in relation to the Inspector\\'s report on the planning appeal, because the Inspector found that there would be no harm to heritage assets and \"as such, this factor has no weight against the grant of planning permission\" (IR 144). Second, the Secretary of State\\'s decision on the appeal involved disagreeing with the Inspector\\'s view that there would be no such harm.

In my judgment the correct approach is to consider whether as a matter of substance, not form, the VSC test was applied taking into account \"other harm\", that is heritage harm (see e.g. City of Edinburgh Council v Secretary of State for Scotland [1997] 1 WLR 1447, 1459-60; East Staffordshire Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2018] PTSR 88 at [50]; Gladman Developments Limited v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government [2020] EWHC 518 (Admin) at [106 to 110]).\\r',\n",

These benefits were also weighed in DL 15 as part of the VSC exercise. There is no reason to think that the benefits in DL 17 and 18 were taken into account in DL 15, but the intervening heritage harm in DL 16 was not. It is plain that these paragraphs overlap.

At CR 12 to 17 the Inspector robustly criticised the Mayor's case on this topic under ground (ii) of the application for costs, holding (inter alia) that the alternatives put forward had been unrealistic. In effect, he decided that that part of the Mayor's case had not been substantiated. Mr. Edwards QC very properly accepted that CR 12 to 17 could not be impugned. But he correctly submitted that if that had been the only finding adverse to the Mayor, it could only have led to a partial award of costs.

He recognised that a decision-maker could come to a different view from that of his officers, but the grounds for doing so would have to be substantiated. That reasoning could only have referred to ground (iii) of the costs application where the Inspector concluded that the Mayor had acted unreasonably by failing to substantiate the objections upon which he relied.

First, as Mr. Edwards QC submitted, it is clear from the material before the court that the Mayor did address himself to section 66(1) of the Listed Building Act 1990 and paragraph 196 of the NPPF from at least the stage 2 Report onwards. Indeed, the Inspector\\'s criticism is contradicted by his conclusions in the main report at IR 72 and 78. In the same vein, the Mayor relied (in part) upon the views of Historic England. So did the Secretary of State in deciding that the sports building would result in \"less than substantial harm\", before going on to agree with the Mayor that that particular harm was outweighed by public benefit. I do not see any rational basis in the Report as to why that behaviour could be criticised as unreasonable. The Mayor made it plain that he was not advancing heritage matters as a freestanding reason for refusal, but as \"other harm\" under MOL policy (paragraphs 52 and 53 of the Stage 2 Report). That was a permissible approach applying Redhill (see above). Both the Mayor\\'s Stage 2 Report and his closing submissions contradict CR 19, where the Inspector, having recognised that the \"other harm\" approach was permissible, then went on to assert that it had not been followed by the Mayor.\\r',\n",

Even when all those three matters are combined together, that could not justify treating all the costs of the inquiry or the appeal process as wasted, which is what the Inspector purported to do at CR 35 and 36, and with which the Secretary of State agreed at DL 4 to 5. A substantial part of the appeal was concerned with the VSC balance which had to be struck under MOL policy. That involved assessing the extent of the harm to the MOL (along with any other harm) and whether the weight to be attached to the benefits of the proposal clearly outweighed that harm. The Inspector made no findings criticising the Mayor's case on that aspect which, of course, was central to his reason for refusal.\\r\",\n",

Here the Inspector rejected the School\\'s contention that the Mayor had unreasonably prevented development which should clearly have been permitted. The Inspector found that the School was wrong to assert that permission should have been forthcoming. On that basis, it is impossible to see how an appeal could have been avoided. Then, the Inspector found that although there were serious flaws in \"elements of the reason for refusal\" (emphasis added), that did not detract from the point that the Mayor had explained why the development was unacceptable based on the reason for refusal, adding that that was \"a reasonable position for the Mayor to have held.\" In effect, the Inspector found that the Mayor had produced sufficient material to substantiate his reason for refusal, certainly in relation to the view he took on the harm to the MOL as against the benefits of the proposal. The conclusions in CR 33, 35 and 36 are therefore flawed.

It appears to be common ground that the addition of this wording departs from the standard text used for a full award.

However, the insertion of the additional wording into the formal order requiring the costs of the inquiry to be paid implies that something less than that might turn out to be justified and payable.

In Carpets of Worth Ltd v Wyre Forest DC 62 P & CR 334, the Court of Appeal held that the Inspector and the local planning authority had failed to have regard to the relevant ministerial circulars and the test of exceptional circumstances when deciding to extend the Green Belt.  Purchas LJ described Green Belt designation as sterilising the area against development, save for the limited categories permitted (at page 345). In Gallagher Homes Limited & Anor v Solihull MBC [2014] EWHC 1283 (Admin), the High Court applied the Carpets of Worth decision, and held that the local planning authority adopted a Local Plan without regard to the exceptional circumstances test for revising Green Belt boundaries.  Hickinbottom J. said, at [132], that \"Green Belt boundaries are intended to be enduring, and not to be altered simply because the current policy means that development of those sites is unlikely or even impossible\\x85. A prime character of Green Belts is their ability to endure through changes of such policies.  For the reasons set out in Carpets of Worth (at page 346 per Purchas LJ) it is important that a proposal to extend a Green Belt is subject to the same, stringent regime as a proposal to diminish it, because whichever way the boundary is altered \"there must be serious prejudice one way or the other to the parties involved\".  \\r',\n",

As to the enduring nature of the designation, the correct policy test is expressly set out in paragraph 99 which provides that an LGS designation should be \"capable of enduring beyond the end of the plan period\".

       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"34. National policy, as expressed through the Framework and National Planning Policy Guidance (PPG), sets a very high bar for LGS designation. The opening sentence, which amounts to the \\'headline\\' message, in paragraph 77 of the Framework, states that LGS will not be appropriate for most green areas of open space. This is a clear message that the bar for LGS designation is set at a very high level. I therefore consider that it is clear from national policy that LGS designation should be the exception rather than the rule. One good reason for national policy setting this high bar is explained in paragraph 78 of the Framework, which states that local policy for managing development within LGS should be consistent with policy for Green Belts.',\n",
       "  '35. In order to reinforce the message that LGS designation is to be used sparingly, paragraph 77 of the Framework sets out three criteria, which spell out where LGS designation should only be used. It is clear from the phraseology that all three of these criteria are necessary for LGS designation. These criteria state that LGS designation should (i) only be used where the green space is in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves; (ii) where it is demonstrably special to the local community (holding a particular local significance); and (iii) where it is local in character and is not an extensive tract of land.',\n",
       "  '36. Para 76 of the Framework places LGS designation in the context of provision of sufficient homes, jobs and other essential services. Therefore, LGS designation has to be integral to the proper planning for the future of communities, and not an isolated exercise to put a stop on the organic growth of towns and villages, which would be contrary to national policy.',\n",
       "  '37. The PPG sets an equally high bar in relation to LGS designation and requires that landowners should be contacted at an early stage about proposals to designate any part of their land as LGS and have opportunities to make representations [ID: 37-019-20140306]. Some landowners at the Hearing sessions claimed that this had not happened, and it is not clear to me that this process has been followed in all cases.',\n",
       "  '38. The clear message in national policy is that LGS designation is to be used sparingly, as part of the overall consideration of the planning and development needs of communities and is not a tool to stop development. The PPG also makes clear that designation of any LGS will need to be consistent with local planning for sustainable development in the area and must not be used in a way that undermines this aim of plan making [ID: 37-007-20140306].',\n",
       "  '39. It is clear from the allocations maps in the Plan, that in not only the eight sample areas I have already referred to, but more generally in relation to all the maps in the Plan, LGS designations have been distributed liberally within the towns and to an even greater extent in several of the villages.',\n",
       "  \"40. The methodology set out in the Council's Background Paper-'Designation of Local Green Spaces' [Document SD20] omits the 'headline' element of the Framework, that LGS designation will not be appropriate for most green areas of open space, and nowhere in this document does that message come through. Although the document describes each site subject to proposed LGS designation, often in some detail, the criterion of being demonstrably special to the local community is not sufficiently rigorous to comply with national policy, and the resultant distribution of LGS designations in several instances can be said to apply to sites which can be described as commonplace (which I do view as a negative term) rather than of a limited and special nature.\",\n",
       "  \"41. I recognise that many if not all the proposed LGS designations are important to local communities; but this is a lower bar than being 'special' and of 'particular local significance'.\",\n",
       "  \"42. In the Council's detailed evidence provided in relation to the eight sample areas that I requested, several proposed LGS designations are already within Conservation Areas, and in a few cases within Flood Zones 2 and 3. Moreover, there are examples of extensive tracts of open land, some of it in agricultural use, in particular on the edge of some villages, where LGS designation appears to be at odds with national policy. These factors were not adequately considered in the LGS assessment work.\",\n",
       "  '43. In some villages for example, several green spaces, including agricultural fields, are joined up to form extensive tracts of land, several of which are located within Conservation Areas and other protective designations, which is contrary to national policy. In some villages, the proposed LGS designations approximate to up to a quarter of the entire urban area of the relevant villages, often with Conservation Area coverage and other constraints.',\n",
       "  '44. Consequently, I suggest the Council has two options:',\n",
       "  \"Option 1: To delete the LGS designations from the Policies Map and remove references to LGS designation where they appear in the Plan.

Sections 38A(3) and 38C(5) and Schedule 4B (of the 1990 Act as modified) govern the process by which such plans are prepared and ultimately brought into force. The Examiner must consider whether the \"basic conditions\" in paragraph 8(2) of schedule 4B are met (paragraph 8(1)). In that regard he or she must be satisfied (inter alia) that it is appropriate to make the plan \"having regard to\" national policies, and that the plan contributes to the achievement of sustainable development and is \"in general conformity with the strategic policies\" of the development plan.

So the requirements of \"soundness\" contained in paragraph 182 of the NPPF do not apply to a neighbourhood plan. Accordingly, there is no need to consider whether a neighbourhood plan is based upon a strategy prepared to meet objectively assessed development and infrastructure requirements, or whether it represents the most appropriate strategy considered against reasonable alternatives and is based upon proportionate evidence (see also paragraph 055 of the Planning Practice Guidance).

       "  '60.\\xa0 In BDW the Claimant challenged the examination of a draft neighbourhood plan which contained a policy limiting the size of new housing sites within or adjacent to a particular settlement to 30 homes. The criticisms included a failure to consider whether constraint policies in the draft plan were compatible with the NPPF (in particular paragraph 47), a failure to address the absence of up-to-date strategic housing policies in a local plan, and a failure to consider whether there was a proper evidential basis to support the draft policy (see paragraphs 78 to 80 of the judgment). The challenge failed. ',\n",
       "  '61.\\xa0 Supperstone J decided that the criticisms failed to appreciate the limited role of the examination of a neighbourhood plan, namely, to consider whether the \"basic conditions had been met\". He held that the Examiner had been entitled to conclude that the draft plan had regard to the NPPF because the need to plan positively for growth was acknowledged and the relevant policy did not place a limit on the total amount of housing to be built (paragraphs 33 and 81 of judgment).

       "  '(ii)\\xa0 The Examiner was not obliged to consider the wider ramifications of the draft policy upon the delivery of housing. The limited role of an Examiner to have regard to national policy when considering a draft policy applicable to a small geographical area should not be confused with the more investigative scrutiny required by the 2004 Act in order for an Inspector examining a draft local plan to determine whether such a plan is \"sound\" (see sections 20(7) to (7C) and 23 of the 2004 Act) (paragraph 83 of the judgment); ',\n",

       "  'i) The examination of a neighbourhood plan, unlike a development plan document, does not include any requirement to consider whether the plan is \"sound\" (contrast s. 20(5)(b) of PCPA 2004) and so the requirements of soundness in paragraph 182 of the NPPF do not apply. So there is no requirement to consider whether a neighbourhood plan has been based upon a strategy to meet \"objectively assessed development and infrastructure requirements\", or whether the plan is \"justified\" in the sense of representing \"the most appropriate strategy, when considered against reasonable alternatives\" and based upon \"proportionate evidence\";',\n",
       "  'ii) Where it is engaged, the basic condition in paragraph 8(2)(e) of schedule 4B to TCPA 1990 only requires that the draft neighbourhood plan as a whole be in \"general conformity\" with the strategic policies of the adopted development plan (in so far as it exists) as a whole. Thus, there is no need to consider whether there is a conflict or tension between one policy of a neighbourhood plan and one element of the local plan;',\n",
       "  'iii) Paragraph 8(2)(a) confers a discretion to determine whether or not it is appropriate that the neighbourhood plan should proceed to be made \"having regard\" to national policy. The more limited requirement of the basic condition in paragraph 8(2)(a) that it be \"appropriate to make the plan\" \"having regard to national policies and advice\" issued by SSCLG, is not to be confused with the more investigative scrutiny required by PCPA 2004 to determine whether a local plan meets the statutory test of \"soundness\".;',\n",
       "  'iv) Paragraphs 14, 47 and 156 to 159 of the NPPF deal with the preparation of local plans. Thus local planning authorities responsible for preparing local plans are required to carry out a strategic housing market assessment to assess the full housing needs for the relevant market area (which may include areas of neighbouring local planning authorities). They must then ensure that the local plan meets the full, objectively assessed needs for the housing market area, unless, and only to the extent that, any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole, or specific policies in the NPPF indicate that development should be restricted (St Albans City Council v Hunston Properties [2013] EWCA Civ 1610; Solihull Metropolitan B.C. v Gallagher Estates Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 1610).',\n",
       "  'v) Those policies in the NPPF (and hence the principles laid down in Hunston and Gallagher in the interpretation of those policies) do not apply to the preparation by a qualifying body of a neighbourhood plan. Although a neighbourhood plan may include policies on the use of land for housing and on locations for housing development, and may address local needs within its area, the qualifying body is not responsible for preparing strategic policies in its neighbourhood plan to meet objectively assessed development needs across a local plan area. Moreover, where the examination of a neighbourhood plan precedes the adoption of a local plan, there is no requirement to consider whether it has been based upon a strategy to meet objectively assessed housing needs.\"',\n",
       "  'In R (DLA Delivery Ltd) v Lewes District Council [2017] EWCA Civ 58; [ 2017] PTSR 949, Lindblom LJ gave guidance on the permissible scope and timing of a neighbourhood plan:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"22. \\x85 . The provisions of Part 2 of the 2004 Act envisage a \"local development scheme\" comprising \"development plan documents\", which will together form the statutory development plan for the local planning authority\\'s area (section 17(3) of the 2004 Act). A neighbourhood development plan, once made, will be a constituent part of the development plan (section 38A(2) of the 2004 Act). As one would expect, the statutory scheme seeks to ensure an appropriate degree of consistency between a neighbourhood development plan and the strategy of the extant, statutorily adopted development plan. That is the essential purpose of the \"basic condition\" in paragraph 8(2)(e). Section 13 of the 1990 Act requires local planning authorities to keep their development plan documents under review. If a neighbourhood development plan has been made and the local planning authority later produces a development plan document containing new \"strategic policies\", that development plan document will, under section 38(5) of the 2004 Act, prevail over any inconsistent policies in the neighbourhood development plan. And if a policy in a neighbourhood development plan is not, or ceases to be, up-to-date, this will be a material consideration in a development control decision, and may justify departing from that policy.',\n",
       "  '23. Nor, in my view, does the language of paragraph 8(2)(e) bear the interpretation urged upon us by Mr Young. The true sense of the expression \"in general conformity with the strategic policies contained in the development plan\" is simply that if there are relevant \"strategic policies\" contained in the adopted development plan for the local planning authority\\'s area, or part of that area, the neighbourhood development plan must not be otherwise than in \"general conformity\" with those \"strategic policies\". The degree of conformity required is \"general\" conformity with \"strategic\" policies. Whether there is or is not sufficient conformity to satisfy that requirement will be a matter of fact and planning judgment (see the judgment of Laws L.J. in Persimmon Homes and others v Stevenage Borough Council [2006] 1 WLR 334, at pp.344D-345D and pp.347F-348F).',\n",
       "  '\\x85',\n",
       "  '25. Paragraph 8(2)(e) does not require the making of a neighbourhood development plan to await the adoption of any other development plan document. It does not prevent a neighbourhood development plan from addressing housing needs unless or until there is an adopted development plan document in place setting a housing requirement for a period coinciding, wholly or partly, with the period of the neighbourhood development plan. A neighbourhood development plan may include, for example, policies allocating land for particular purposes, including housing development, even when there are no \"strategic policies\" in the statutorily adopted development plan to which such policies in the neighbourhood development plan can sensibly relate. This may be either because there are no relevant \"strategic policies\" at all or because the relevant strategy itself is now effectively redundant, its period having expired. The neighbourhood development plan may also conform with the strategy of an emerging local plan. It may, for example, anticipate the strategy for housing development in that emerging plan and still not lack \"general conformity\" with the \"strategic policies\" of the existing development plan.',\n",
       "  '26. This understanding of paragraph 8(2)(e) is consistent with national policy and guidance in the NPPF and the PPG. As Foskett J. recognized (in paragraph 129 of his judgment), such policy and guidance is not an aid to statutory interpretation. However, the policies in paragraphs 184 and 185 of the NPPF reflect the statutory requirement, in paragraph 8(2)(e), for a neighbourhood development plan to be in \"general conformity\" with the \"strategic policies\" of the development plan, and the references to the \"Local Plan\" in those policies of the NPPF are clearly to a statutorily adopted local plan, not an emerging plan. Both NPPF policy and the guidance in the PPG are designed to prevent the mischief of a neighbourhood development plan frustrating the strategy of an up-to-date local plan. But the encouragement in paragraph 184 for local planning authorities to \"set out clearly their strategic policies for the area and ensure that an up-to-date Local Plan is in place as quickly as possible\" does not imply that only when an up-to-date local plan has already been adopted will it be possible for a neighbourhood development plan to be taken though its own statutory process. The guidance in the PPG explicitly accepts that a neighbourhood development plan can be prepared \"before or at the same time\" as a local plan, and explains how a local planning authority should proceed if the neighbourhood development plan is brought forward first. Such guidance would have been unnecessary and inappropriate if the statutory scheme required the preparation of the neighbourhood development plan to be held back until an up-to-date local plan is in place.\"',\n",

Church Mead is an integral part of the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, forming a transition between the village and the adjacent open countryside. It is adjoined by built development to the north/northeast (centred on the George Inn) and to the west (around the church). Whilst the Conservation Area is generally inward looking, its significance also derives from outward views afforded by its elevated position in the landscape. That is amply demonstrated in the sudden, quintessentially English view out from the George car park and the summit of Bell Hill over the lower slopes, including Church Mead which forms an important visual link between the centre of the village and the countryside beyond.

Even with reinforcement of the hedge/tree line along the northern boundary of the appeal site, the development proposed would create a much stronger urban presence than is currently the case in those views and would intrude into the experience of the Conservation Area. On completion, the development would also link the Fortescue Fields site with other parts of the village, including recently approved residential development on land to the west. As a consequence, Church Mead would be enclosed on all sides by built form and the crucial link through to the open countryside beyond would be obliterated. ',\n",

I recognise that substantial harm is a high test and may not arise in many cases. In this case however, I consider that the development proposed would have a considerable adverse impact on the setting and significance of the Conservation Area, completely altering its historic development pattern and plan form, with significant consequences for one of the most important and clearly cherished views into and out of the Area. To my mind, the scale of that harm verges on substantial. There would be corresponding harm to the established character and appearance of the area more generally.

Such appeals may involve a range of issues raised by a number of parties to do with the planning merits of a proposal for development. By contrast the ambit of an examination into a neighbourhood plan is rather different. Generally, the main focus is on whether or not the basic conditions in paragraph 8(2) of schedule 4B are satisfied, or would be satisfied by the making of modifications to the plan.

I therefore accept that the ratio of Young does not expressly support the Inspector's approach in the current case of Test 3 involving an unfettered balance.

       "  '\"Confirmation of the Order would lead to a significant decrease in public enjoyment of the path between Bodicote and Bloxham, although not greatly so (paragraph 59). It would lead to a very significant increase in the privacy and a significant increase to the security of the applicants. It seems to me that I should take into account that the effect on public enjoyment might be lasting whereas the applicants will benefit only for as long as they occupy the Mill although, as I noted above, future owners would probably benefit too. I should also take into account, I consider, that the enjoyment of a greater number of people would be affected while only those resident at the Mill would immediately benefit from confirmation of the Order. On the other hand people\\'s enjoyment of the path would be affected principally only when they were walking the diverted path, while the benefit to the applicants would be felt continually. It is a difficult balance to make, but overall I conclude that the interests of the applicants prevail, and that it is expedient to confirm the Order.\" ',\n",
       "  '4.\\tIn paragraph 70, under the heading \"Other matters\", the Inspector said: ',\n",
       "  '\"I mention here two arguments which were each raised in a number of objections. The first is that because the applicants knew of the existence of the footpath when they bought the Mill it is not legitimate for them to expect that it should be diverted. The second argument is that if this diversion is allowed it might set a precedent for the diversion of other paths which pass close to nearby mills. Understandable though these arguments might be, they are not relevant to the tests for confirmation set out in s119 of the 1980 Act.\" ',\n",
       "  \"5.\\tIt is conceded by the Secretary of State and by the two individual defendants and asserted by the claimant that the Inspector erred in law in treating those two matters as irrelevant. The Secretary of State was indifferent initially as to whether the decision should be quashed, but accepted in the end that he could not say that without those errors the Inspector's decision would inevitably have been the same. The Westons contend that the decision would plainly and inevitably have been the same.\",\n",
       "  \"Therefore, the legal issue for the Judge was whether the accepted error would have made any difference to the ultimate outcome, and therefore whether he should quash the decision. At [7] the Judge records that the Ramblers' Association, represented by Mr Laurence, had raised a wider point about the interpretation of s.119. Mr Laurence was arguing that although Test 3, the second expediency question, could raise the same issues as at the earlier stage, the background to those issues and the weight that could be attached to them could differ, see [21]. Ouseley J rejected this argument as being untenable and unnecessarily complicated, see [23].\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Judge then said at [28-31]:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"28.\\tMr Laurence's submissions accepted, at least at some stage as I understood them, that the expediency issue in section 119(6) was not confined to the specific factors in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), nor to the effect of compensation on the land onto which the path might be diverted. It could encompass the factors said to be unlawfully omitted in paragraph 70, and indeed the fact of historical integrity. In my judgment, that is the right approach to section 119(6) and expediency. It covers all considerations that are material. The fact that there is a focus given by the statute to specifying factors does not narrow down the scope of expediency in its application at that stage. That is by clear contrast with the scope of expediency in section 119(1) which is directed to what is expedient for the interests of the land owner. \",\n",
       "  '29.\\tSo far as the discretion which Mr Laurence contends arises is concerned, in my judgment it is clear that there is no further discretion. The Secretary of State has different powers where he, as Mr Buley points out, correctly, in his skeleton argument, is the recipient of a report from an Inspector. As he is the decision-maker, he may disagree with the conclusions of the Inspector, and that is why the Secretary of State \"may\" confirm or not confirm the order. That is because he is entitled to come to a different conclusion on the outcome of the statutory questions from that to which the Inspector has come. ',\n",
       "  '30.\\tWhere, however, the Inspector is the decision-maker, there is nothing to suggest that there is a residual discretion to come to a view other than that to which the answer to the questions of section 119(6) would otherwise point. I cannot conceive of circumstances in which, having properly answered the section 119(6) questions and concluded that it was expedient in relation to both questions that the diversion order be made, an Inspector (or Secretary of State) rationally could say that nonetheless the order should not be confirmed. It is difficult to see what factors could animate such a decision which were not relevant to the expediency issues under section 119(6). The fact that such a discretion could only lead, if exercised adversely to the decision which would otherwise be arrived at, to an irrational basis, strongly supports my view that the discretion does not exist at all. A discretion only to act unlawfully is a discretion scarcely worth having. ',\n",
       "  '31.\\tThe Inspector, therefore, made no error in the structure of his approach. But even if his structure had been wrong, I cannot see that such an error in structure could conceivably have affected the outcome of his decision-making. I found it difficult to follow how considering the same factor at different stages with a different background could lead to a different conclusion unless it was the result of utter confusion caused by the statutory structure for which Mr Laurence contends.',\n",
       "  'The submissions',\n",
       "  'The parties agreed that s.119(6) involved three separate tests, as described in the case law set out above. The first test was whether it was in the interests of the landowner for the path to be diverted. This was described by Mr M Supperstone QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) in R (Hargrave) v Stroud District Council [2001] EWHC Admin 1128, [2002] JPL 1081 at [34(i)] as being a low test. The second test is whether the proposed diversion is \"substantially less convenient\" to the public. Both of these tests could be described as gateway tests. Unless they are passed the decision-maker does not get to the third test, namely whether it is expedient to confirm the diversion. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Laurence submitted that the Inspector erred in law in her application of the third test because she carried out a full balancing exercise taking into account the benefits to the landowner of the proposed diversion, as well as other material considerations. It was Mr Laurence's case that for the third test the benefits to the landowner and the convenience of the diverted path were irrelevant, the only factors that could be taken into account at that stage were those set out in s.119(6)(a), (b) and (c). \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Laurence based his submissions both on what he said was the purpose of s.119 and its structure. He argued that the purpose was to provide for a low gateway test to allow the landowner's application to be proceeded with so long as he could show that it was in his interests for the path to be diverted and the diversion was not substantially less convenient to the public. However, he said that when it came to the third test, there was a deliberate choice by the draughtsman that the decision-maker could only consider those matters which tended against confirmation. Therefore on s.119(6)(a) only negative impacts on public enjoyment could be taken into account. His skeleton argument on this point states:\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"\\x85 if, in a given case, the Secretary of State is satisfied that the order should be confirmed (having had regard to the effect to the contrary which the matters mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) may have), the order will be confirmed.  Conversely (given the negative terms in which sub-section (6) is drafted (\"shall not confirm unless\")), if the \"effect\" of any of the matters to which the Secretary of State is to have regard is negative or adverse, the Secretary of State could and would not ordinarily be satisfied that it was expedient to confirm the order.  A failure of the Secretary of State to be satisfied that it is expedient to confirm means that Constraint No. 3 is not overcome, and so the order will not be confirmed\".',\n",
       "  'He argued that s.119(6) (a), (b) and (c) are giving reasons why the order should not be confirmed and are there to assist the public in resisting confirmation, but that there are provisions to mitigate that effect, for example compensation to any third party landowner adversely affected.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'On (b) it was Mr Laurence\\'s argument that this was only concerned with land outside the ownership of the landowner. This was because \"other land\" meant land outside that in s.119(1), i.e. land not owned by the landowner who made the application. On (c) he said this was concerned with negative effects on the land over which the proposed diversion was to run.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Laurence argued that the focus on the effects which were against confirmation can be seen from the words at the end of s.119(6) which allow the decision-maker to consider the mitigation given to the third party land owner(s) by compensation. This he says shows that the effects that the statute has in mind are negative effects, which are then capable of being mitigated. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'He argued that the Inspector was wrong to rely on Young because the ratio of that case was limited to the issue of not conflating the convenience test in Test 2 with expediency in Test 3. To the degree the question of enjoyment was raised by the Claimant in Young at [29] that was not necessary to the case. In the alternative Young was wrong, if it was finding that Test 3 allowed an unfettered balance. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'On Weston Mr Laurence said that Ouseley J was wrong to find that factors (a), (b) and (c) in s.119(6) were not exhaustive and that a balancing exercise could be undertaken at that stage.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Laurence strongly argued that the third test cannot allow an unfettered balancing exercise because to do so would create unfairness. It would always be easier for the landowner to articulate the effect on his interests, whereas public enjoyment would be more difficult to describe or quantify. In oral submissions he focused on the argument that the applicant landowner could engineer a situation where he benefited at the expense of a third party landowner. He posited the example of a landowner who bought a property with a footpath running close to the house much to its detriment. That landowner would then be able to propose a diversion away from his house and onto the land of a third party, potentially much to the detriment of their property but in a significantly more convenient and enjoyable location for the public. In this situation the Inspector would inevitably confirm the diversion and the landowner would have gained a significant benefit at the expense of adjoining owners. Mr Laurence acknowledged that the adjoining owner would be entitled to compensation, but he pointed out that financial compensation might well not mitigate the true impact on the adjoining owner\\'s enjoyment of his property, albeit it would compensate for loss of value and \"disturbance\". He argued the applicant landowner will have bought the property at a lesser price because of the very existence of the footpath but may still desire to have the footpath moved. He argued that this ability to cause detriment to the neighbouring landowner showed that the Inspector\\'s interpretation could create unfairness.\\r',\n",

He described Test 3 as being a less \"hard-edged\" test than Tests 1 and 2.  He said that the Claimant\\'s construction of s.119 was unduly complex and did not reflect either the words of the section or the purpose or mischief of the statute. He argued that the factors in s.119(6)(a), (b) and (c) were mandatory material considerations but they did not exclude other factors being taken into consideration. \\r',\n",

He also relied on caselaw concerning s.118 HA 1980 which is in similar terms to s.119. In R v Secretary of State for the Environment ex p Stewart (1980) 39 P&CR 534 Phillips J held that the word \"expedient\" in s.110(2) Highways Act 1959 must allow other considerations to be brought into play and involved a broad judgement. In R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Cheshire County Council [1991] JPL 537 Auld J followed Ex p Stewart and referred to the expediency test in s.110(2) as involving a \"broader and discretionary question\" in contrast to s.118(1). \\r',\n",

       "  'Conclusions',\n",
       "  \"In my view the Secretary of State's interpretation of s.119 is plainly to be preferred and the Inspector did not err in law. Mr Laurence's construction is overly and unnecessarily complicated, involves writing words into the statute that are not there, and makes little sense in terms of the working of the provision. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The starting point is that s.119(6) does not state that sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) are exclusive factors. Although this is not conclusive, the use of the word \"expedient\" suggests that a broad balance or judgement is to be made by the decision-maker. If it had been intended that the expressly stated factors in (a) to (c) were an exclusionary list then it might be expected that the draughtsman would have made this clear. Just taking the words at face value it seems more likely that (a) to (c) are mandatory factors to be taken into account, but that they are not intended to exclude all other factors. This would explain why those factors are listed but others such as the scale of the owner\\'s interest in the diversion is not.  This does not in any way contradict Mr Justice Ouseley\\'s point at [30] in Weston that once the expediency question is answered in Test 3 there is no residual discretion for the Secretary of State to then reach a different decision. If the Secretary of State concludes that it is expedient to make the Order, then there is no further residual discretion. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"There is nothing in the words of the provision that supports Mr Laurence's argument that (a) to (c) are limited to matters which tend against confirmation of the order. This does not appear from the words and is not necessary to make the provision make sense or be capable of being operated effectively. The fact that (a) to (c) are matters which go against confirmation merely requires the Secretary of State to ensure that those negative factors are taken into consideration. To that degree they support non-confirmation, but that does not mean that no other factors pointing the other way can be considered. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"The strongest argument against Mr Laurence's construction is that it would involve what, in my view, are obviously relevant factors being made legally irrelevant. On his argument, as he accepted, the scale of the benefit to the landowner of the diversion would be irrelevant. Once the owner had met Test 1, which was described in R (Hargrave) v Stroud District Council 2001 EWHC Admin 1128, [2002] JPL 1081 at [34(i)] as a low threshold, the scale of benefit becomes irrelevant. This is simply nonsensical. If the reason for the diversion is the benefit to the owner then the decision-maker must be able to consider what weight is to be given to that benefit, depending on how great the benefit is judged to be. Equally, on Mr Laurence's construction, the degree to which there is a benefit to the enjoyment of the public by the diversion of the path is irrelevant. Again, that makes no sense, particularly when it is borne in mind that under s.119(1) the application for the diversion could be made by the local authority on the grounds that it is in the interests of the public for the path to be diverted. So again, the very raison d'être of the diversion becomes irrelevant once the threshold in Test 1 is passed. Mr Laurence focused on the scenario by which the landowner applies for the diversion, and that is the facts of the present case. But the statutory scheme specifically allows the local authority to apply on the ground of expediency to the public. Therefore, the scale of any benefit to the public must in my view be a relevant consideration.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Westaway pointed to the other public interests that would be taken out of the expediency balance, such as the interests of agriculture, forestry or biodiversity. Mr Laurence's answer is that these are taken into consideration at the order-making stage, but in my judgement that is no answer. The biodiversity impacts may be such as to be an important element of the decision whether or not to confirm the order. It again makes no sense for the decision-maker not to be able to take them into account in deciding expediency at the Test 3 stage.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Laurence is correct that the effect of this construction is that a landowner could purchase land at a discount because of the existence of a path across the land. He could then apply for a diversion of that path onto third party land, thus potentially devaluing that land and reducing the third party owner's enjoyment of his land. The third party owner would be entitled to compensation but the applicant landowner might still well end up increasing the value of his property by more than the compensation he had to pay. However, I do not take this scenario to mean that the Secretary of State's construction of the section is wrong. It is unlikely, though not impossible, that the diversion in this scenario would be approved if there was not a clear public benefit. But in any event, that there is provision for compensation makes it quite clear that the applicant owner can benefit by the diversion at the potential expense of the third party owner. There is nothing unlikely about Parliament accepting a scenario whereby the applicant landowner does gain a benefit and the third party a disbenefit in circumstances where there is a benefit in the public interest in the diversion. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'I also do not accept the Claimant\\'s argument that the \"effects\" in subsection (6) must be adverse effects. This is simply not reflected in the words of the statute and involves a reading in which in my view would be wholly illegitimate. I do not accept Mr Laurence\\'s argument that the draughtsman has created Test 3 in this manner in order to prevent the landowner from gaining an advantage. The section is not structured in that manner and the argument ignores the fact that it could be the local authority which makes the original application on the grounds of public interest. The end result would be an interpretation which was both unduly complicated and would not achieve any clear cut statutory purpose. \\r',\n",

The PINS Advice Note, and the Decision Letter, therefore overstate the reliance on Young. However, Turner J did accept the argument being put, so he does appear to have considered that the argument that there should be a balance was correct. In any event, Ouseley J in Weston did accept that (a)\\x96(c) were not exhaustive factors in Test 3. The fact that he did so on the basis of concessions by both parties does not mean it is not a central part of his judgment. In my view both Young and Weston support the analysis I have set out above. \\r',\n",

This error alone was sufficient he said to quash the decision. I do not accept the submission. I agree with Mr Laurence that the appropriateness of carrying out a balancing exercise was not part of the ratio of Young. But the Inspector's reliance on Young did not lead her into any error of law. Her conclusion as to the approach under s.119(6) was, in my view, entirely correct and her understanding that the requirement for a balancing was part of the ratio of Young was not itself an error of law which had any possible impact on the decision. \\r\",\n",

The principal building, Providence Cottage, is some 19 metres from the annex with a driveway running between the two. Planning permission was refused in 2014 for the conversion of the garage/outbuilding on the site to be converted into a separate dwelling. The garage/outbuilding was subsequently adapted to provide an annex which, according to the Interested Party\\'s planning consultant, forms an integral part of the single planning unit. It was this building which formed the subject of the 2019 application. I note at this point that there had been no planning application or grant of permission in respect of the use of the outbuilding as a residential annex. There is an email from a planning officer at the Council, Mr Croft, dated 15 January 2015 in which he says \"it would appear that the annexe forms an integral part of the residential planning unit, and accordingly use of the annexe, as described, does not constitute development for which planning permission is required.\" Mr Croft requested that a unilateral undertaking be entered into which would prevent the annex from being sold or rented separately or have a separate curtilage created. No such undertaking was entered into. Therefore, at the point the 2019 application was made, the annex was in residential use and the Council had accepted that was a lawful use which did not require permission. \\r',\n",

The wording of paragraph 79(d) is not qualified by reference to what form the existing residential development must take, nor is it clear why that would be especially relevant to the principle of sub-division.

       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"The relevant law is not controversial. It comprises seven familiar principles: ',\n",
       "  '(1) Decisions of the Secretary of State and his inspectors in appeals against the refusal of planning permission are to be construed in a reasonably flexible way. Decision letters are written principally for parties who know what the issues between them are and what evidence and argument has been deployed on those issues. An inspector does not need to \"rehearse every argument relating to each matter in every paragraph\" (see the judgment of Forbes J. in Seddon Properties v Secretary of State for the Environment (1981) 42 P. & C.R. 26, at p.28). ',\n",
       "  '(2) The reasons for an appeal decision must be intelligible and adequate, enabling one to understand why the appeal was decided as it was and what conclusions were reached on the \"principal important controversial issues\". An inspector\\'s reasoning must not give rise to a substantial doubt as to whether he went wrong in law, for example by misunderstanding a relevant policy or by failing to reach a rational decision on relevant grounds. But the reasons need refer only to the main issues in the dispute, not to every material consideration (see the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in South Bucks District Council and another v Porter (No. 2) [2004] 1 WLR 1953, at p.1964B-G).',\n",
       "  '(3) The weight to be attached to any material consideration and all matters of planning judgment are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the decision-maker. They are not for the court. A local planning authority determining an application for planning permission is free, \"provided that it does not lapse into Wednesbury irrationality\" to give material considerations \"whatever weight [it] thinks fit or no weight at all\" (see the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Tesco Stores Limited v Secretary of State for the Environment [1995] 1 WLR 759, at p.780F-H). And, essentially for that reason, an application under section 288 of the 1990 Act does not afford an opportunity for a review of the planning merits of an inspector\\'s decision (see the judgment of Sullivan J., as he then was, in Newsmith v Secretary of State for [2001] EWHC Admin 74, at paragraph 6). ',\n",
       "  '(4) Planning policies are not statutory or contractual provisions and should not be construed as if they were. The proper interpretation of planning policy is ultimately a matter of law for the court. The application of relevant policy is for the decision-maker. But statements of policy are to be interpreted objectively by the court in accordance with the language used and in its proper context. A failure properly to understand and apply relevant policy will constitute a failure to have regard to a material consideration, or will amount to having regard to an immaterial consideration (see the judgment of Lord Reed in Tesco Stores v Dundee City Council [2012] PTSR 983, at paragraphs 17 to 22).',\n",
       "  '(5) When it is suggested that an inspector has failed to grasp a relevant policy one must look at what he thought the important planning issues were and decide whether it appears from the way he dealt with them that he must have misunderstood the policy in question (see the judgment of Hoffmann L.J., as he then was, South Somerset District Council v The Secretary of State for the Environment (1993) 66 P. & C.R. 80, at p.83E-H).',\n",
       "  '(6) Because it is reasonable to assume that national planning policy is familiar to the Secretary of State and his inspectors, the fact that a particular policy is not mentioned in the decision letter does not necessarily mean that it has been ignored (see, for example, the judgment of Lang J. in Sea Land Power & Energy Limited v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2012] EWHC 1419 (QB), at paragraph 58). ',\n",
       "  '(7) Consistency in decision-making is important both to developers and local planning authorities, because it serves to maintain public confidence in the operation of the development control system. But it is not a principle of law that like cases must always be decided alike. An inspector must exercise his own judgment on this question, if it arises (see, for example, the judgment of Pill L.J. Fox Strategic Land and Property Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2013] 1 P. & C.R. 6, at paragraphs 12 to 14, citing the judgment of Mann L.J. in North Wiltshire District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment [1992] 65 P. & C.R. 137, at p.145).',\n",
       "  'The present case turns on the correct interpretation of planning policy, namely para 79 of the NPPF. It is therefore important to have regard to what Lord Reed said in Tesco v Dundee CC in the Supreme Court at paras 17-21;\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '17.\\tIt has long been established that a planning authority must proceed upon a proper understanding of the development plan: see, for example, Gransden & Co Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment (1985) 54 P & CR 86, 94 per Woolf J, affd (1986) 54 P & CR 361; Horsham DC v Secretary of State for the Environment (1991) 63 P & CR 219, 225-226 per Nolan LJ. The need for a proper understanding follows, in the first place, from the fact that the planning authority is required by statute to have regard to the provisions of the development plan: it cannot have regard to the provisions of the plan if it fails to understand them. It also follows from the legal status given to the development plan by section 25 of the 1997 Act. The effect of the predecessor of section 25, namely section 18A of the Town and Country (Planning) Scotland Act 1972 (as inserted by section 58 of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991), was considered by the House of Lords in the case of City of Edinburgh Council v Secretary of State for Scotland 1998 SC (HL) 33, [1997] 1 WLR 1447. It is sufficient for present purposes to cite a passage from the speech of Lord Clyde, with which the other members of the House expressed their agreement. At p 44, 1459, his Lordship observed: ',\n",
       "  '\"In the practical application of sec 18A it will obviously be necessary for the decision-maker to consider the development plan, identify any provisions in it which are relevant to the question before him and make a proper interpretation of them. His decision will be open to challenge if he fails to have regard to a policy in the development plan which is relevant to the application or fails properly to interpret it.\" ',\n",
       "  '18.\\tIn the present case, the planning authority was required by section 25 to consider whether the proposed development was in accordance with the development plan and, if not, whether material considerations justified departing from the plan. In order to carry out that exercise, the planning authority required to proceed on the basis of what Lord Clyde described as \"a proper interpretation\" of the relevant provisions of the plan. We were however referred by counsel to a number of judicial dicta which were said to support the proposition that the meaning of the development plan was a matter to be determined by the planning authority: the court, it was submitted, had no role in determining the meaning of the plan unless the view taken by the planning authority could be characterised as perverse or irrational. That submission, if correct, would deprive sections 25 and 37(2) of the 1997 Act of much of their effect, and would drain the need for a \"proper interpretation\" of the plan of much of its meaning and purpose. It would also make little practical sense. The development plan is a carefully drafted and considered statement of policy, published in order to inform the public of the approach which will be followed by planning authorities in decision-making unless there is good reason to depart from it. It is intended to guide the behaviour of developers and planning authorities. As in other areas of administrative law, the policies which it sets out are designed to secure consistency and direction in the exercise of discretionary powers, while allowing a measure of flexibility to be retained. Those considerations point away from the view that the meaning of the plan is in principle a matter which each planning authority is entitled to determine from time to time as it pleases, within the limits of rationality. On the contrary, these considerations suggest that in principle, in this area of public administration as in others (as discussed, for example, in R (Raissi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] QB 836), policy statements should be interpreted objectively in accordance with the language used, read as always in its proper context. ',\n",
       "  '19.\\tThat is not to say that such statements should be construed as if they were statutory or contractual provisions. Although a development plan has a legal status and legal effects, it is not analogous in its nature or purpose to a statute or a contract. As has often been observed, development plans are full of broad statements of policy, many of which may be mutually irreconcilable, so that in a particular case one must give way to another. In addition, many of the provisions of development plans are framed in language whose application to a given set of facts requires the exercise of judgment. Such matters fall within the jurisdiction of planning authorities, and their exercise of their judgment can only be challenged on the ground that it is irrational or perverse (Tesco Stores Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment [1995] 1 WLR 759, 780 per Lord Hoffmann). Nevertheless, planning authorities do not live in the world of Humpty Dumpty: they cannot make the development plan mean whatever they would like it to mean. ',\n",
       "  '20.\\tThe principal authority referred to in relation to this matter was the judgment of Brooke LJ in R v Derbyshire County Council, Ex p Woods [1997] JPL 958 at 967. Properly understood, however, what was said there is not inconsistent with the approach which I have described. In the passage in question, Brooke LJ stated: ',\n",
       "  '\"If there is a dispute about the meaning of the words included in a policy document which a planning authority is bound to take into account, it is of course for the court to determine as a matter of law what the words are capable of meaning. If the decision maker attaches a meaning to the words they are not properly capable of bearing, then it will have made an error of law, and it will have failed properly to understand the policy.\"',\n",
       "  'By way of illustration, Brooke LJ referred to the earlier case of Northavon DC v Secretary of State for the Environment [1993] JPL 761, which concerned a policy applicable to \"institutions standing in extensive grounds\". As was observed, the words spoke for themselves, but their application to particular factual situations would often be a matter of judgment for the planning authority. That exercise of judgment would only be susceptible to review in the event that it was unreasonable. The latter case might be contrasted with the case of R (Heath and Hampstead Society) v Camden LBC [2008] 2 P & CR 233, where a planning authority\\'s decision that a replacement dwelling was not \"materially larger\" than its predecessor, within the meaning of a policy, was vitiated by its failure to understand the policy correctly: read in its context, the phrase \"materially larger\" referred to the size of the new building compared with its predecessor, rather than requiring a broader comparison of their relative impact, as the planning authority had supposed. Similarly in City of Edinburgh Council v Scottish Ministers 2001 SC 957 the reporter\\'s decision that a licensed restaurant constituted \"similar licensed premises\" to a public house, within the meaning of a policy, was vitiated by her misunderstanding of the policy: the context was one in which a distinction was drawn between public houses, wine bars and the like, on the one hand, and restaurants, on the other.',\n",
       "  '21.\\tA provision in the development plan which requires an assessment of whether a site is \"suitable\" for a particular purpose calls for judgment in its application. But the question whether such a provision is concerned with suitability for one purpose or another is not a question of planning judgment: it is a question of textual interpretation, which can only be answered by construing the language used in its context. In the present case, in particular, the question whether the word \"suitable\", in the policies in question, means \"suitable for the development proposed by the applicant\", or \"suitable for meeting identified deficiencies in retail provision in the area\", is not a question which can be answered by the exercise of planning judgment: it is a logically prior question as to the issue to which planning judgment requires to be directed',\n",
       "  'Submissions',\n",
       "  'Mr Mohamed\\'s submissions, supported by Mr Westmoreland Smith, are as follows. The starting point is that the meaning of \"dwelling\" within para 79(d) is a question of law, and as such a matter for the court. \"Dwelling\" is a word which takes its meaning from its context, and therefore limited assistance is to be drawn from other statutory contexts and the caselaw upon them. The context of the NPPF, and paras 77-79 in particular, points strongly to the exception in para 79(d) being narrowly construed. The use of the word \"sub-division\" combined with \"dwelling\" indicates that the sub-paragraph is concerned with one physical building. If the NPPF had intended to include the sub-division of a residential planning unit, or a residential plot, then it would have used different words. The purpose or intent of the NPPF strongly points in favour of the narrow construction because otherwise the policy could give rise to a proliferation of new dwellings in isolated rural locations, which is plainly contrary to the overall intention of the NPPF in respect of such locations. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Mohamed points to a number of recent appeal decisions since the changes to the NPPF in July 2018 where Inspectors have taken the narrower approach to para 79(d). I have been taken to five appeal decisions in which para 79(d) has been in issue where a variety of different conclusions have been reached by the Inspectors involved. It is apparent that Inspectors have differed in their interpretation of the sub-paragraph rather than having just differed on its application to the facts of the case before them. Ultimately those decisions do not help me very much because the interpretation of the policy is a matter of law for the Court and the Inspectors\\' decisions do not show any clear indication of their approach to the policy. What is clear is that there is considerable confusion over what \"dwelling\" in para 79(d) means and there is an issue of law which needs to be determined. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Westmoreland Smith supported these arguments. He pointed out that the consultation draft version of the 2018 NPPF had at para 79(d) used the word residential \"property\", but this had been changed in the final version to \"dwelling\". He said that this was to prevent larger curtilages being developed as a result of the policy change and there was a deliberate choice to focus on the building rather than the plot. He said that it had been the Secretary of State\\'s intention that para 79(d) would apply to the subdivision of single houses, not wider residential properties or curtilages. He supported Mr Mohamed\\'s submission that para 79 set out a series of exceptions to the policy of avoiding development of isolated homes in the countryside and, as such, the exceptions should be narrowly construed. He also points to the fact that \"dwelling\" is not the word used in the rest of chapter 5 of the NPPF, rather it refers to \"homes\" and therefore dwelling must have been meant to have a narrow definition. \\r',\n",

The Court of Appeal there was considering what was the \"dwelling\" for the purposes of assessing capital under the Jobseekers Allowance Act. Mr Miah and his family occupied two adjoining properties, and the issue was whether both should be disregarded. At [26] Ward LJ said;\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'If one approaches construction of the words literally, one notes that the word \"dwelling\" has been chosen, not, for example, \"dwelling-house\" nor \"residential accommodation\". \"Dwelling\" is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"Place of residence; dwelling-place, habitation, house\". \"Dwelling-place\" is \"A place of abode\", whereas \"Dwelling-house\" is \"A house occupied as a place of residence, as distinguished from a house of business, warehouse, office, etc.\" Because the single word is expanded into a phrase \"dwelling occupied as the home\" I am given the impression that the legislature intended to convey the function to be served by the concept of a dwelling rather than to connote its constituent elements, the bricks and mortar of the dwelling. The function is a place serving as home for the claimant. That place is not necessarily confined to a single building. For me this emphasis is reinforced by the inclusion within \"dwelling\" of \"any garage, garden and outbuildings normally occupied as his home including any premises not so occupied \\x85\". A barn converted for residential accommodation is part of the dwelling constituted by the farmhouse and that converted barn. I appreciate that not too much can be derived from that analogy because they both lie within the same curtilage, but it gives the flavour.',\n",
       "  'Mr Wadsley relies on this passage for the reference to the Oxford English Dictionary that \"dwelling\" is a \"place of residence\" and Ward LJ\\'s point that the Legislature had, by using the word \"dwelling\", focused on the function of the property rather than the bricks and mortar. To my mind the critical point that emerges from this case is that the context of the words used are key. In Miah the context suggested that the dwelling was not confined to one building and the policy background was the disregarding of the property for the purpose of means testing benefits. The context here is an entirely different one, and the reasons for focusing on the building rather than the wider unit is quite clear in a planning policy document where the issue is the form of physical development which is or is not supported by national policy. \\r',\n",

       "  \"On the basis of the various different definitions of dwelling, Mr Wadsley argues that the approach the Inspector took, that the dwelling included the residential annex, was one that was clearly open to her on the language and therefore was an application of the policy that fell within her planning judgement. On the policy, he argued that the NPPF supported a boost to the number of houses and the Inspector's construction of the policy supported an increase in housing. There was no obvious reason for the difference between allowing sub-division of a single house and allowing the sub-division of the residential unit. Both would lead to more households in the rural area, so the stated policy intent was not as clear cut as the Council and Secretary of State were suggesting. \\r\",\n",

He argued that to rely on the exception in para 79(d), the building for which planning permission was being sought would have to meet this test. For the reasons I have set out below I am not sure this analysis is correct, and, in any event, I do not think it would act effectively to limit the scope of the exception. \\r',\n",

       "  'In my view Mr Mohamed and Mr Westmoreland Smith\\'s arguments are correct, and the Inspector erred in law in her approach to para 79(d) of the NPPF. The starting point is that the meaning of \"dwelling\" within the paragraph is a question of the interpretation of policy, and not its application. The issue is whether \"dwelling\" means a single residential building, or a wider residential unit that can include secondary buildings within the same plot. That issue is capable of one objective answer regardless of the facts of any particular case, and as such falls within [18] of Tesco v Dundee as being a matter of law. This is the type of case where there is a difference from the ex p Woods approach to the approach of the Supreme Court in Tesco v Dundee.  The issue is not whether the word \"dwelling\" is reasonably capable of carrying the meaning given to it by the Inspector but rather whether that is the correct meaning in the policy context.  Once that issue of law is determined there may well be questions of planning judgement on a particular case as to whether those facts fall within para 79(d), for example whether the building being sub-divided is properly described as one dwelling or not. \\r',\n",

Although it is always possible to posit clearer or different words that could have been used, if the Secretary of State had intended to encompass sub-division of the residential plot then it would have been more natural to use the words \"the residential unit\" or \"the property\". To my mind, sub-division of a dwelling, implies a single building. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The change from the consultation draft of the 2018 NPPF which used the word \"property\" to the final version which used the word \"dwelling\" supports the Secretary of State\\'s position that the intention was to narrow the exception and keep it to the single residential building. I should make clear at this point that, in my view, the Secretary of State\\'s stated intention, as set out in the GLD letter and Mr Westmoreland Smith\\'s written submissions, carries very little if any weight. As Lord Reed said in Tesco v Dundee it is not up to a policy maker to say what they think the policy means. It therefore cannot be open to the Secretary of State to say what he intended the policy to mean unless he can point to some contemporaneous document which shows that policy intent at the time the document was finalized. The only document that Mr Westmoreland Smith can point to is the change between the consultation draft and the final version. There is apparently nothing in the consultation response from the Secretary of State which deals with the point, and there is nothing equivalent to a White Paper or travaux preparatoire for the NPPF. Therefore, I am not assisted by the Secretary of State\\'s asserted intention, save to the degree to which it is reflected in the change from consultation to final version of the NPPF. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Most importantly, in my view the context strongly militates towards a narrow interpretation. The sub-paragraphs in para 79 are exceptions to the general policy against creating new residential development in isolated rural locations. It is important to have in mind that the policy reason for not supporting new housing in such locations is that it would be fundamentally unsustainable, being poorly located for local services, and that sustainability lies at the heart of the NPPF. As such, it does in my view follow that the exceptions should be narrowly construed as being in general not supportive of sustainable development. The exceptions are all forms of development which could be said to enhance the countryside, whether by adding housing for rural workers, or reusing redundant buildings. As the letter from GLD dated 15 January 2020 states, para 79(d) makes sense in this context as allowing the sub-division of large properties into flats where that is a good use of the existing dwelling. To allow the sub-division of residential units by allowing separate buildings to become separate dwellings goes well beyond that limited exception.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Wadsley argues that there is support in the NPPF for a boost in housing supply and the Inspector's interpretation meets this policy intent. However, it is clear from Chapter 5 of the NPPF, and paras 77-79 in particular, that the general thrust of the policy to increase housing is specifically excluded when it comes to the creation of isolated homes in rural locations. Therefore, I do not think the broader policy in the NPPF is of assistance.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Wadsley argues that as the policy plainly allows the sub-division of single residential buildings, there is no sound policy reason to say that it does not apply to the sub-division of residential units. However, there is in my view a very material distinction between sub-division of a single building and the type of sub-division which Mr Wadsley says falls within the policy. Many residential properties in the countryside have some form of outbuildings whether garages, sheds or barns. It is not entirely clear from Mr Wadsley\\'s submissions what he says would be included in the \"residential dwelling\" in para 79(d) and whether the secondary building had to already be in actual residential use. On the facts of this case, the outbuilding/garage was being used for residential purposes and had been laid out with a bedroom, living room and bathroom. Therefore, both buildings could be said to be being used for residential purposes before the application for a separate dwelling. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \" However, it is also clear that the change from being used as a garage/outbuilding to a residential use was done without planning permission and the Council's officer Mr Croft had accepted that it did not need planning permission. Subject to there being no need for any operational development requiring permission, and there being no issue of planning conditions, then internal alterations of an outbuilding to allow ancillary residential use (i.e. not the creation of a separate residential dwelling) would not require planning permission. It follows from this that if para 79(d) supported the sub-division of a residential planning unit into two separate dwellings, then the implications could be very wide. Any residential property with a suitable outbuilding into which a residential use could be inserted would then have policy support to become a separate dwelling. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Therefore, even if the secondary building has to be in residential use at the point at which reliance is sought to be placed on para 79(d), this will often not be a difficult step to achieve. These issues merely highlight the potential extent of the exception to the policy against isolated rural development that would be created if Mr Wadsley's interpretation was correct.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'For all these reasons I find that the Inspector erred in law in her interpretation of the word \"dwelling\" and the decision must be quashed and the appeal redetermined. \\r',\n",

       "  'Yateley Common was registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965 (\"the 1965 Act\"). It was entered on the register kept by the Claimant, Hampshire County Council (\"HCC\"). Blackbushe Airport is operated by the First Interested Party, Blackbushe Airport Limited (\"BAL\"). Most of the airport lies within the area of the common. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'On 1 November 2016 BAL made an application to HCC under paragraph 6 of schedule 2 to the Commons Act 2006 (\"the 2006 Act\") to remove from the register that part of the airport which had been included as common land, referred to as an application for de-registration. HCC then referred the application to the Defendant, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for determination, pursuant to regulation 26 of the Commons Registration (England) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014 No. 3038) (\"the 2014 Regulations\").\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The application land comprised some 46.5 hectares (or 115 acres) of operational land which included the runway, taxiways, fuel storage depot and in the south-eastern part of the site, the terminal building (including control tower), the Bushe Café and car parking. The terminal building has a footprint of about 360 sq m and an overall floor area of about 760 sq m. It is a two-storey building.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Defendant\\'s Inspector held a public inquiry on 2 to 5 April 2019. The application was opposed by HCC. The Open Spaces Society (\"The OSS\"), the Second Interested Party, also appeared at the inquiry to oppose the application along with other objectors notably Mr. Peter Tipton (an individual with commoners\\' rights over Yateley Common including the site of the application for de-registration), Councillor David Simpson and Councillor Adrian Collett (respectively the Third, Fourth and Fifth Interested Parties). \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",

The Defendant (represented by Mr. Ned Westaway) opposes the application supported by BAL (represented by Mr. Douglas Edwards QC and Mr. George Mackenzie).

The land had been provisionally registered as part of Yateley Common on 16 May 1967 and that registration became final on 26 March 1975. Those opposing the application raised a number of other issues which were resolved by the Inspector and are not in contention in these proceedings.

       "  'The Inspector addressed those submissions in a careful decision letter (\"DL\"). In DL 43 the Inspector referred to the judgment of Lieven J in Challenge Fencing Limited v Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government [2019] EWHC 553 (Admin) for the helpful summary at [18] of several factors which he said \"may inform a decision on the existence and extent of curtilage in any given case\": -\\r',\n",

       "  '(iv)\\tWhether the building or land within the claimed curtilage is ancillary to the main building will be a relevant consideration, but it is not a legal requirement that the claimed curtilage should be ancillary Skerritts p.67C;',\n",
       "  '(v)\\tThe degree to which the building and the claimed curtilage fall within one enclosure is relevant, Sumption at para 17 and the quotation from the OED of curtilage as \"A small court, yard or piece of ground attached to a dwelling house and forming one enclosure with it\". In my view this will be one aspect of the physical layout, being the first of the Calderdale factors.\"',\n",
       "  'The Inspector sought to apply these \"factors\" in his decision letter. For the purposes of the application to de-register under the 2006 Act it was unnecessary for him to refer to or apply principle (vi) in the judgment of Lieven J.',\n",
       "  'BAL submitted at the inquiry that it was appropriate for this list of factors drawn from Challenge Fencing to be applied by the Inspector. HCC did not argue otherwise, so far as the list goes, either at the inquiry or in this court. Instead, HCC has raised two specific grounds of challenge: -\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '(i)\\tThe Inspector failed to apply an additional test said to be derived from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Skerritts of Nottingham Ltd v Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001] QB 54, namely whether the size of the land exceeds anything which could properly be described as the curtilage of the relevant building, in this case the terminal building;\\r',\n",
       "  '(ii)\\t The Inspector misunderstood the concept of \"ancillariness\" by deciding that both the land was ancillary to the terminal building and that the building was ancillary to the land at one and the same time.',\n",
       "  'The OSS\\'s submissions raised broader, rather more fundamental questions. There was no objection to their entitlement to do so in these proceedings. Although The OSS acknowledged that the criteria in Challenge Fencing at [18] were relevant factors to be taken into account, they submit that by themselves they were insufficient for the purposes of identifying the curtilage of a building under paragraph 6 to schedule 2 to the 2006 Act. De-registration of an area of common land results in the extinguishment of any rights of common over that land without any compensation. The OSS recognises that the word \"curtilage\" has not been defined by Parliament and is generally treated as not being a term of art, but they submit that the court should nevertheless grapple with the issues raised by the present case and with the risk of applications being made to deregister extensive areas of common land. They submit that if the Inspector\\'s approach in the present case is permissible, then de-registration might follow for more familiar examples of large open space uses, such as sport or recreation, occupying common land and making use of buildings (e.g. a golf course with its club house and training facilities). The OSS therefore asks the court to identify the \"concept\" of \"curtilage\" adopted in the 2006 Act. They contend that it should be a stricter approach associated with conveyancing practice, the effect of which would be to confine the curtilage of a building to an area which would pass under a conveyance of that building without being expressly mentioned in the deed or transfer.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Tipton made submissions in support of the grounds of challenge advanced by HCC and the broader case of The OSS. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Both the Secretary of State and BAL submit that there is no justification for adopting a stricter approach to the concept of \"curtilage\" than set out in Challenge Fencing at [18]. Instead, they contend that the 2006 Act itself strikes a balance between the competing interests of landowners holding property rights in or over a common and that the interpretative approach of the court to the language used by Parliament should be neutral. In their oral submissions they advanced the following overarching principle for determining whether under this legislation an area of land lies within the curtilage of a building: is the land and building associated in such a way that they comprise part and parcel of the same entity, a single unit, or an integral whole (see also paragraphs 13, 16-17 and 36 of the Defendant\\'s skeleton and paragraph 12 of BAL\\'s skeleton). They say that this was the test applied by the Inspector in his decision.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr. Westaway and Mr. Edwards QC also claim that the Inspector identified the test they propound at DL 54 where he said as follows: -\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"The guidance which appears to be given in the above cases is that land which may form the curtilage of a building is land which is part and parcel of the building (Trim), or forms one enclosure with the building (Dyer) which serves the purposes of the building in some necessary or reasonably useful way (Sinclair-Lockhart) or is intimately associated with the building such that the land is part and parcel of the building and an integral part of the same unit (Methuen-Campbell) and does not have to be small but relative size is a relevant consideration (Skerritts).\"',\n",
       "  'But it will be apparent that that passage identifies a very different test for identifying the curtilage of a building, namely whether the land in question forms part and parcel of that building and, as we shall see, that test was also laid down in Dyer and Sinclair-Lockhart.',\n",
       "  \"The Secretary of State and BAL submit that the principles in Challenge Fencing at [18] are relevant to the application of the overarching principle for which they contend. They say that the Inspector has lawfully applied that approach and they resist the criticisms made in HCC's two grounds of challenge.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'It will be necessary to see whether the overarching principle suggested by counsel is supported by the authorities. For example, it does not appear in the list of principles at [18] of Challenge Fencing or elsewhere in that decision.\\r',\n",

Section 16 enables the owner of land registered as common land or as a town or village green to apply for de-registration subject to (1) providing replacement land where the area of the application site is greater than 200 sq m and (2) consideration of the rights of others over the land, the interests of the neighbourhood and the public interest.

I also note that the curtilage of a building is land which is attached to, and forms one enclosure with, that building, but that concept needs to be understood by examining the case law carefully.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The related terms \"messuage\" and \"appurtenance\" cast further light on the meaning of \"curtilage\". A \"messuage\" means the land occupied by a dwelling-house and its appurtenances, or a dwelling-house together with its outbuildings and the adjacent land assigned to its use, the emphasis being on the appurtenances, outbuildings and use of the dwelling-house (or building). Likewise, \"appurtenance\" denotes something belonging to another, or a minor property or right belonging to another more important property or right.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",

       "  'Statutory context',\n",
       "  'A number of authorities state that the sense in which \"curtilage\" is used is sensitive to the language used by Parliament and the context or purpose of the legislation (e.g. Roskill LJ in Methuen-Campbell [1979] QB at 539E).\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'For example, Pilbrow v Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch [1895] 1 QB 433 was cited for the proposition that an area of land must be relatively small in extent for it to qualify as curtilage land (p. 438). But there the court was concerned with the distinction under public health legislation between a \"drain\" and a \"sewer\" for the purposes of deciding whether expenses were to be borne by the owners of buildings or by local ratepayers. The statute defined \"sewer\" in part by excluding anything falling within the definition of a \"drain\". A \"drain\" referred to any drain for the drainage of only one building or \"premises within the same curtilage\". The majority of the Court of Appeal decided that in this context \"curtilage\" had not been used in a conveyancing law sense. It was not limited to a single building with its outbuildings. It could also include several buildings which have a curtilage which was common to all. In that context it was necessary to consider the mode of building, the purpose for which the buildings had been erected and how they were used. It was held that the drains in question serving two blocks of flats separated by a relatively small yard related to \"premises within the same curtilage\". On the other hand, drainage serving a large number of buildings erected around a square would not relate to \"premises within the same curtilage\".\\r',\n",

Here the issue is whether land qualifies as forming the curtilage of a building, not drainage serving \"premises [comprising more than one building] within the same curtilage\". As the cases show, the words chosen by Parliament, \"the curtilage of a building\", are of critical importance.\\r',\n",

The landlord appealed against the decision in the County Court that the paddock should be included in the claim to enfranchise because it was an appurtenance of the house ([1979] QB at 532A).

By the time of Trim v Sturminster District Council [1938] 2 QB 508 it was settled that an appurtenance was confined to the curtilage of the property (1979 QB at 533-5). Relying upon the dictionary definition of \"curtilage\", and treating its application as a question of fact, Goff LJ decided that the \"comparatively extensive\" area of pasture which had been divided from the house and garden, could not be treated as part of the curtilage of the house. The paddock was no more than a valuable amenity for the occupier. The fact that it had been let together with the house and garden as one unit, albeit relevant, was not of much weight. These factors were insufficient for the paddock to form part of the curtilage of the dwelling ([1979] QB at 536-8).\\r',\n",

       "  'Buckley LJ agreed that although \"appurtenance\" may include land, it may not include anything which would not pass on a conveyance of the principal subject matter without being specifically mentioned, and therefore could only extend to land or buildings within the curtilage of the principal subject-matter (p.543A). This approach has sometimes been referred to as the \"conveyancing approach\" to curtilage. But I do not think that that label is a helpful way to understand the principles in Methuen-Campbell and similar authorities for identifying the curtilage of a building. Buckley LJ pointed out that the fact that a conveyance of a parcel of land described in general terms will pass all the component parts of its curtilage without express mention is simply the legal consequence of those parts falling within that curtilage. That conveyancing consequence is not a criterion by which the extent of the curtilage should be identified (544C-D).\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Instead, the correct approach is set out in the following oft-cited passage from the judgment of Buckley LJ (543F to 544D). This is also one of the key passages upon which Mr Westaway and Mr Edwards QC sought to base their overarching principle:- \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"What then is meant by the curtilage of a property? In my judgment it is not sufficient to constitute two pieces of land parts of one and the same curtilage that they should have been conveyed or demised together, for a single conveyance or lease can comprise more than one parcel of land, neither of which need be in any sense an appurtenance of the other or within the curtilage of the other. Nor is it sufficient that they have been occupied together. Nor is the test whether the enjoyment of one is advantageous or convenient or necessary for the full enjoyment of the other. A piece of land may fall clearly within the curtilage of a parcel conveyed without its contributing in any significant way to the convenience or value of the rest of the parcel. On the other hand, it may be very advantageous or convenient to the owner of one parcel of land also to own an adjoining parcel, although it may be clear from the facts that the two parcels are entirely distinct pieces of property. In my judgment, for one corporeal hereditament to fall within the curtilage of another, the former must be so intimately associated with the latter as to lead to the conclusion that the former in truth forms part and parcel of the latter. There can be very few houses indeed that do not have associated with them at least some few square yards of land, constituting a yard or a basement area or passageway or something of the kind, owned and enjoyed with the house, which on a reasonable view could only be regarded as part of the messuage and such small pieces of land would be held to fall within the curtilage of the messuage. This may extend to ancillary buildings, structures or areas such as outhouses, a garage, a driveway, a garden and so forth. How far it is appropriate to regard this identity as parts of one messuage or parcel of land as extending must depend on the character and the circumstances of the items under consideration. To the extent that it is reasonable to regard them as constituting one messuage or parcel of land, they will be properly regarded as all falling within one curtilage; they constitute an integral whole. The conveyance of that messuage or parcel by general description without reference to metes or bounds, or to the several component parts of it, will pass all those component parts sub silentio. Thus a conveyance of The Gables without more, will pass everything within the curtilage to which that description applies, because every component part falls within the description. The converse proposition, that because an item of property will pass sub silentio under such a conveyance of The Gables, it is therefore within the curtilage of The Gables, cannot in my opinion be maintained, for that confuses cause with effect.\"',\n",

Buckley LJ did not decide that an area of land is within the curtilage of a building if it is associated with a building in such a way that the land and building comprise part and parcel of the same entity, a single unit, or an integral whole. Nor did he suggest that \"part and parcel\", \"single unit\" and \"integral whole\" were synonymous terms to be used in that manner (see para. 22 of BAL\\'s opening submissions at the inquiry; paras. 86-90 of BAL\\'s closing submissions and para. 12 of BAL\\'s skeleton).\\r',\n",

In the same vein, I note from another of its decisions cited by the Court of Appeal,  Clymo v Shell-Mex & BP Limited (1963) 10 RRC 85; [1963] RVR 471, that the legal concept of \"appurtenance\" is something belonging to a house or building, although not necessarily used for the purposes of that house or building (pp. 473 and 474).\\r',\n",

But that passage cannot be taken as departing from the clear test he had already laid down, namely whether land is so intimately associated with a building as to form part and parcel of that building. That was the test to which Buckley LJ returned at p. 545A when, acknowledging that the paddock provided an amenity for and enhanced the value of the house, he added the key words \"but the paddock can serve that purpose perfectly well without being part and parcel of the house\". \\r',\n",

He held that that approach was inconsistent with the law on \"appurtenance\" previously laid down by the Court of Appeal in Trim v Sturminster Rural District Council [1938] 2 KB 508. In that case a wide interpretation could only have assisted the landowner to resist the interference with his property rights by the statutory demolition order served by the local authority, but the court nevertheless gave the term its \"ordinary meaning\". Goff LJ continued at p. 536G  by referring to cases where the concept of \"curtilage\" has been used when applying legislation for protecting landowners faced with the expropriation of part of their land (i.e s. 92 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, now s. 8 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965), but they did not support a wider approach to that term.\\r',\n",

The station building had a large yard to the rear, beyond which there was a row of garages. It was surrounded by a high wall, with a gate which led on to a path to which ten houses had access.

The building has to be considered in its setting, as is made clear by the amendment to section 56(3), and by paragraph 25 of circular no. 23/77, as well as with any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses. The setting of a building may consist of much more than man-made objects or structures, but there may be objects or structures which would not naturally or certainly be regarded as part of a building or features of it, but which nevertheless are so closely related to it that they enhance it aesthetically and their removal would adversely affect it. Such objects or structures may or may not be intrinsically of architectural or historic interest, or worth preserving but for their effect on a building which is of such interest. But if the building itself is to be preserved unless the Secretary of State consents to its demolition, so also should those objects and structures be. That object is achieved by section 54(9) requiring them to be treated as part of the listed building. They do not thereby become absolutely immune from demolition, but the power is there to give or withhold consent to the demolition of all or some of them. If that is the right approach, it indicates a broad approach to the subsection as a whole and a construction of it which will enable the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion to grant or withhold listed building consent over a wide rather than a narrow field.\"',\n",

For the same reasons the 2006 Act refers to the \"curtilage of a building\" without concentrating solely on any \"objects\" or \"structures\" it may contain. These differences in language, context and statutory purpose are so substantial that the listed building code is not truly analogous to the provisions in the 2006 Act dealing with de-registration, or correcting the non-registration, of common land or towns or village greens.

The object of the legislation considered in Dyer and Barwick was to define the scope of local authority housing to which a tenant\\'s right to buy applied. It was not to do with conveyancing as such. It cannot be said that the \"part and parcel of the building\" test was a strict conveyancer\\'s approach.

The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the High Court, holding that there was no requirement for a curtilage to be \"small\". Robert Walker LJ stated that in the context of Part I of the Listed Building Act 1990, \"the curtilage of a substantial listed building is likely to extend to what are or have been, in terms of ownership and function, ancillary buildings\". He noted that \"physical layout\" is also relevant and added that \"the curtilage within which a mansion\\'s satellite buildings are found is bound to be relatively limited\", although the concept of \"smallness\" is an unhelpful criterion.

The concept of \"the curtilage of a building\" is also used in the definitions of various permitted development rights granted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (SI 2015 No. 596) (for example in Parts 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7).\\r',\n",

That provision referred to the amount by which the \"value of land with the benefit of planning permission \\x85 exceeds the value which it would have without the benefit of such permission\".

He then went on to arrive at the same result by treating \"land\" as meaning the land upon which the permitted development would stand and such other land as would in law be regarded as \"an integral part\" of that building and hence its curtilage (pp. 203-4). He based that principle on the decision of the House of Lords in Caledonian Railway Company v Turcan [1898] AC 256 at 263, 266. The decision does not contain a list of the various factors which might be taken into account in defining a curtilage in a particular case, for example those summarised by Buckley LJ in Methuen-Campbell or by Lieven J in Challenge Fencing. But the key point is that the principle identified by Lord Mackintosh, that the curtilage of a building must form an integral part of  that building, is the same as that laid down by Buckley LJ and also by Nourse LJ in Dyer ([1989] QB at p 358D), and not the test given by Skinner J in Calderdale.

Those provisions do not form a statutory code for the protection of heritage or other assets. Permitted development rights are generally to be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the language used (English Clays Lovering Pochin & Co.

She did not adopt the overarching principle for which the Defendant and BAL contend in this case. Instead, at [14] Lieven J referred to the key statement of Nourse LJ in Dyer (at p.358D) that \"an area of land cannot properly be described as a curtilage unless it forms part and parcel of the house or building which it contains or to which it is attached.\" That is the same approach as Buckley LJ laid down in Methuen-Campbell (pp.543-4).\\r',\n",

That principle does not accord with Methuen-Campbell, Dyer, or Barwick, where, in a statutory context analogous to the present one, the correct question to ask is whether the land in question forms part and parcel of the relevant building. The latter approach reflects the ordinary meaning of \"curtilage\" and is not driven by any expropriatory considerations. That last point is reinforced by the fact that the key test laid down in those cases has been adopted in authorities dealing with general planning law.\\r',\n",

Even so, the approach in Calderdale was qualified in Debenhams by the addition of a test which requires those additional structures or objects to be ancillary to the building identified in the statutory list.\\r',\n",

       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'HCC raises two points. First, it submits that the Inspector erred in law by holding that the application land is ancillary to the terminal building. The terminal building is ancillary to the application land and not the other way round because the building exists only to serve the activities taking place on the airport land and the requirements which they give rise to. Second, HCC submits that the Inspector erred in holding that at one and the same time the application land was ancillary to the terminal building and the terminal building was ancillary to the application land. Those findings are inconsistent with the very essence of one thing being ancillary to another.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Defendant responds that it is not a legal requirement that land be ancillary to a building in order to fall within its curtilage. On the first point the Defendant relies upon the fact that the Inspector also made a finding that the application land was ancillary to the terminal building, because the latter acted as \"the hub\" for the airport, containing the control tower from which all aircraft movements were controlled and the administration and support facilities (DL 68, 77 and 81). On the second point, the Defendant submits that the word \"ancillary\" is not a term of art. It simply means subservient or subordinate. Property A may be subservient to property B in some respects and property B may be subservient to property A in others. That is effectively how the Inspector treated the application land and the terminal building. He regarded the two as being mutually supportive. This is what HCC had described as \"functional equivalence\" in order to support their case that the application land could not be within the curtilage of the terminal building. But the Inspector adopted the response advanced by BAL, namely that the functional equivalence demonstrated that the land and the building formed an integral part of the same unit (DL 80-82). That is a reference to the overarching principle for defining a curtilage for which both the Defendant and BAL have contended in this court. The Defendant submitted in writing that if nonetheless the Inspector\\'s reasoning on the \"ancillary\" issue involved an error of law, the court should refuse relief on the basis that it is highly likely that the outcome for HCC would not have been substantially different if the conduct complained of, that is the reasoning in the decision letter, had not occurred (s.31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981). That contention was not pursued at the hearing. Instead, Mr. Westaway submitted that the reasoning criticised by HCC was not material to the Inspector\\'s conclusion.\\r',\n",

In relation to the same function or use carried out on two areas of land, I do not see how, as a matter of ordinary English, each area of land can be said to be ancillary to the other. That formulation does not allow any room for one of the two areas of land to have \"primary\" status. The notion of something being \"ancillary\" is meaningless unless that can be related to something else with a primary role.\\r',\n",

       "  'Furthermore, in this case the \"ancillary\" factor should have been applied in order to help decide whether the operational land was within the curtilage of the terminal building, not whether the terminal building was within the curtilage of the operational land. So, the only question on \"ancillariness\" which could support the proposition that the operational land was within that curtilage was whether the operational land was ancillary to the terminal building, and not the other way round. If the answer to that particular question was \"yes\", then that would lend support to that proposition, albeit that would not be conclusive. But if the answer was \"no\", then that would be a pointer against the operational land being within the curtilage of the terminal building. Not surprisingly, neither the Defendant nor BAL referred to any authority in which a finding that the use of a building was ancillary to the use of other land was relied upon to support a conclusion that the land lay within the curtilage of the building.\\r',\n",

No doubt most of that function could be described as important or even essential to the running of the airport. Without that control and support it is doubtful whether the airport could be operated, at least in its current format. But I do not see how rationally it could be said that the use of the operational land for aircraft movements, storage and maintenance could be said to be ancillary to the function of the terminal building. Aircraft movements are the raison-d\\'être of the airport. Without them the terminal building would be pointless. It is illogical to suggest that the use of the operational land is ancillary to the building the purpose of which is to facilitate and support, even control, those movements. For these reasons I conclude that the Inspector, having decided to take the \"ancillariness\" criterion into account as a relevant factor, misunderstood what is meant by \"ancillary\" when he came to apply it.\\r',\n",

The correct principle is that for property to qualify as falling within the curtilage of a building, it must form part and parcel of that building. The question is not whether the building forms part and parcel of some unit which includes that land, or whether those two items taken together form part and parcel of an entity or an integral unit. The fact that in DL 54 the Inspector did summarise case law setting out the correct principle (see paragraph 16 above) is nothing to the point.

Here the planning unit would comprise the operational land and the building within which, either there is a single main purpose, namely that of an airport, to which the various activities are incidental, or else it is not possible to say that one activity is incidental to another. The flaw in BAL\\'s approach is that it asks whether the building in question forms part of some larger unit. That is impermissible when the question posed by the statute is whether land forms part of the relevant building, and thus falls within its curtilage.

He said that although the claimed curtilage land might appear \"excessive\" compared to the relatively small size of the terminal building, in the context of the purposes to which the building and land are put that was not the case (DL 75). According to the Inspector the context was that the operational land and the terminal building formed part of a general aviation airport.

On the Inspector\\'s approach the whole of a golf course could be said to fall within the curtilage of the clubhouse because the relative size of the open land used for the course and its setting is proportionate to the functions and purpose for which both the land and the building are used.

But those phrases merely describe the consequence of having applied the correct legal approach for identifying the curtilage of the building. They do not supply a test for identifying a curtilage.\\r',\n",

       "  'If on the other hand it were to be permissible to identify a curtilage by asking whether the building and claimed curtilage land formed a single unit with \"functional equivalence\", or in effect were used for the same overall purpose, other factors which have until now been treated as relevant considerations would have a much reduced, or even possibly no, significance. It would not matter whether the land serves any ancillary function. Equivalence of function, or being \"mutually supportive\", would suffice. As this case amply demonstrates, \"relative size\" would have much less or possibly no significant effect in restraining the extent of a curtilage. Even if the size of the alleged curtilage land would appear to be \"grossly disproportionate\" to the size of the relevant building (or buildings), that could be overcome merely by the fact that that size is proportionate to the purposes by which the building and land are put. It would also make it difficult to say, as in Dyer and Skerritts, that the area of land was altogether in excess of anything that could be described as the curtilage of the building. The same reasoning as the Inspector adopted in the present case could be replicated for an even larger airfield with a single building, or for a golf course or other open air recreational facility occupied with a club house.

       "  'By a Claim Form, issued under Part 8 CPR, on 19th September 2019, the Claimant, T & P Real Estate Limited (T&P), seek a declaration that its proposed development, at Sutton Park House, 15 Carshalton Road, Sutton SM1 4LD (the Property), namely the change of use of the property from an office use to a residential use, fell within the ambit of an exception to an Article 4 Direction made by the Defendant, the London Borough of Sutton (Sutton), in November 2013, as modified by the Secretary of State, on 30th July 2014, and that, in consequence, the proposed development constitutes permitted development, by reason of and pursuant to Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015 (the 2015 Order).\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'By an application, dated 22nd October 2019, Sutton applies to strike out this Claim as an abuse of process. This judgment relates to that application.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The background to this Claim and to this application is, for a non-planner, not wholly straightforward.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In the barest of outlines, the broad effect of the 2015 Order and of its relevant predecessor, the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (the 1995 Order), was and is to grant, without need of specific application, planning permission for those classes of development identified in the relevant Order. Change of use from office use to residential use (B1 to C3) is one of the classes of development so permitted.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Development, pursuant to the permission granted by both the 1995 and 2015 Orders, was and is, however, conditional. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Firstly, permitted development is conditional upon application being first made as to whether prior approval is required in respect of a variety of environmental matters associated with the proposed development. That application being made, development can only commence, following upon one of three matters; receipt of a written approval; receipt of a written notice that prior approval is not required; or the passage of 56 days from the date that the application for prior approval is received, without any determination of the application being made.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Secondly, under the 1995 Order, a limitation was placed upon the permission granted by that Order, namely that the permitted use had to be in place by 30th May 2016. That limitation was, however, removed by the 2015 Order, as currently amended and replaced with a requirement that the permitted development must be completed within three years of the prior approval date.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Both the 1995 and 2015 Orders contain, or contained, provisions enabling a planning authority to make a direction (known as an Article 4 direction) having the effect of removing, in appropriate circumstances, the entitlement of a developer to rely upon the permissions otherwise arising from the orders in question. The issue of construction raised in this case is as to the true construction of an exception, or limitation, to the removal of permitted development rights contained in an Article 4 Direction made by Sutton.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The issue arises in the following way.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In December 2014, prior approval was granted to a company called G4S Cash Solutions (UK) Limited (G4S), the then beneficial and legal owner of the Property, in respect of a scheme for the change of the use of the Property from office to residential. That scheme has never been implemented and, in consequence, the permission for that development, pursuant to that prior approval lapsed in December 2017.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' In November 2013 and, therefore, well in advance of  the grant of the December 2014 prior approval, Sutton had taken steps to issue an Article 4 Direction, in relation to an area of land forming part, or all, of Sutton Town Centre and including the Property. That Direction was expressed to come into effect upon 29th January 2015 and, in its original form, would have removed the permission existing in favour of the putative developer unless the proposed development had been completed by that date.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"However, by December 2014, the Article 4 Direction had been modified by the Secretary of State, so as to include the exception, or limitation, the construction of which is the subject of the current Claim. The effect of the exception was to exclude from the area in respect of which general development rights had been, or would have been, removed, by reason of the Article 4 Direction, 'any building or land in relation to which prior approval \\x85has been granted, or \\x85 is treated as granted before 29th January 2015'. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The clear and undisputed consequence of the exception was to retain, in favour of the then putative developer, or any successor, even after the Article 4 Direction had come into force, the extant permission to develop the Property, in accordance with the scheme for which prior approval had been granted and to exclude, as regards that scheme, the Property from the area of land in respect of which general development rights would,  by reason of the Article 4 Direction have, otherwise, been withdrawn. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The question which is raised in these proceedings, however, and which has already been raised in other proceedings (see: R (on the application of Berkshire Assets (West London) Ltd) v London Borough of Hounslow [2018] EWHC 2896 (Admin) (Berkshire)) is the extent to which, on its true construction, the exception has the further effect of retaining general development rights in respect of buildings and land where prior approval has been granted, in this case, prior to 29th January 2015, but in respect of schemes other than those where that prior approval has been granted..\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In this regard, in Berkshire, the Planning Court, in Judicial Review proceedings, in respect of the refusal of prior approval applications, by the London Borough of Hounslow, in a case where an Article 4 Direction contained an exception in near identical terms to that with which this case is concerned, determined that, on the true construction of that exception, the effect of the exception, at least in circumstances where, at the point  when new applications for prior approval were made, previous prior approvals remained extant, was to exclude the effect of the Article 4 Direction, in removing general development rights, from buildings and land in respect of which such extant prior approvals remained in being. The consequence of that construction and determination was that, in respect of such land and buildings, general development rights were retained, with the result that it was open to a developer to put forward for prior approval, in reliance upon those rights, schemes of development, falling within those rights, other than the scheme, or schemes, for which extant prior approvals had been granted.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In this case, as is set out above, the prior approval granted by Sutton in December 2014 expired, or lapsed, in December 2017. Notwithstanding that lapse, in March 2019, Lawlor (Holdings) Limited (Lawlor), a company related to T&P, applied for prior approval, in respect of a new development scheme, in respect of the Property. The new scheme, as with the old lapsed scheme, contemplated change of use from office use to residential use and would, accordingly and subject to the requisite prior approval, constitute permitted development, if and provided that the lapsed prior approval had the effect, on the true construction of the exception, of continuing general development rights in respect of the Property, notwithstanding the terms of the Article 4 Direction.  \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In May 2019, Sutton issued a refusal notice in respect of that application.  The essential ground of that refusal, other than in respect of certain concerns as to parking, was its contention that, in circumstances where the prior approval in respect of the Property had lapsed, any general development rights protected by the exception had, on the true construction of the exception, fallen away and, therefore, that no such rights existed in respect of which prior approval could be granted.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'That refusal and that construction of the exception has been appealed to the Planning Inspectorate by Lawlor, pursuant to section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act) and the appeal was heard on 19th November 2019. The decision of the Planning Inspectorate is awaited.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' The issue raised in that appeal is, as is common ground, identical to the issue raised in these proceedings. T&P contend that the lapse of the 2014 prior approval does not have the effect, on the true construction of the exception, of removing general development rights and precluding, therefore, the permitted development for which it has sought prior approval. Conversely, Sutton contend that, at least where prior approvals have lapsed at the date of any new application for prior approval, the effect of the exception, properly construed, is to bring to an end any permitted development rights which, but for the lapse of the relevant prior approval, might, by reason of the exception, continue to exist in respect of land falling within the Article 4 Direction and including, therefore, the Property.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \" T&P contend that this result is reached by the application of the literal construction of the words of the exception and that because a prior approval had been granted in respect of the building and land making up the Property, prior to 29th January 2015, the effect of the exception is to retain permitted development rights in respect of the Property, indefinitely and irrespective of the lapse of the prior approval which gives rise to this consequence. Sutton, in contrast, contends that that approach requires the words 'has been granted' to be read as 'was once granted' and that, having regard to the context and purpose underlying the Article 4 Direction and the exception, the exception should not be given the wider meaning and effect for which T & P contend.  \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Lawlor's appeal was lodged in June 2019. By that date, however, T & P had become interested in the Property, by reason of the beneficial interest in the Property that it has obtained, pursuant to a contract of sale, dated 24th May 2019, between itself and G4S. It is that interest in the Property that gives T&P its potential standing to pursue the current proceedings.       \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"As already stated, it is not in dispute but that the point of construction, as to the effect of the exception, which is raised in Lawlor's appeal, is the self-same point of construction as is raised in these Part 8 proceedings. Nor, given that Lawlor and T&P are related companies and that Lawlor is pursuing the same argument in both the Part 8 proceedings and the appeal and by the same legal advisers, has any point been taken that the parties to the litigation are different to the parties to the appeal.  \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In these circumstances, Sutton grounds its application to strike out on two bases. Firstly, it is submitted that the issue in question is exclusively one of public law and that, for that reason, it is a misuse of the Part 8 procedure, for it to be used to procure a declaration of such, exclusively, public law rights. Secondly, it is submitted that, irrespective of the public law point, it is a misuse, or abuse, of the Part 8 process, or of process generally, to bring the current proceedings, when the self-same point is already in process of determination by the Planning Inspectorate and where, as here, the unsuccessful party would be in a position to seek to challenge the decision of the Planning Inspectorate in the Planning Court, pursuant to section 288 of the 1990 Act.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In regard to the first and, perhaps, principal basis upon which Sutton seeks to strike out, I have deliberately set out in some detail the facts, circumstances and legislative and administrative provisions which underlie the current proceedings and which demonstrate, as I see it, that the issue raised, namely the construction of a local authority planning Direction is quintessentially one of public, rather than private, law. It is not a matter that applies, or operates, exclusively, as between T&P and Sutton, but, rather, as acknowledged by T&P, is one that affects, potentially and equally, a number of property owners, or putative developers in the area falling within the Article 4 Direction and who have the benefit of lapsed prior approvals. Nor, is there any suggestion, in this case, that the public law question raised, in respect of the construction of the Article 4 Direction, is, in any sense, interlinked with, or related to, or, as it is put in one case, homogenised with any separate private law right, or rights, obtaining as between T&P and Sutton, upon which T&P relies in support of its claim for declaratory relief.        \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"The relevance of that conclusion, for purposes of the present case, stems from the seminal speech of Lord Diplock, in O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237, and from the so-called 'exclusivity principle' arising from that case. That principle, at page 285 D to E, establishes that 'as a general rule' it is 'contrary to public policy, and as such an abuse of the process of the court to permit a person seeking to establish that a decision of a public authority infringed rights to which he was entitled to protection under public law to proceed by way of an ordinary action and by that means to evade the provisions of Order 53' (now CPR 54) 'for the protection of such authorities'.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"There seems to me to be no doubt that the purpose of the declaratory relief sought by T&P, as to the construction of the Article 4 Direction and the exception, is, precisely, to establish that the decision of Sutton to refuse prior approval in respect of the development of the Property, on the basis of Sutton's construction of the exception, infringes T&P's right, on its construction of the exception, to exercise its public law right to carry out permitted development of and at the Property and that, as such, this case falls, squarely, within the scope of the general rule, identified by Lord Diplock, in O'Reilly v Mackman, such that the attempted litigation of the matter, other than  by the processes which have been put in place for the determination of public law rights and challenges, constitutes an abuse, or misuse, of process.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In this case, as was, carefully, explained to me, by counsel, the relevant process for a public law challenge to Sutton's decision would, ordinarily, be by way of the process Lawlor has adopted; that is to say by way of appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, pursuant to section 78 of the 1990 Act and, if needs be, appeal to the Planning Court, pursuant to section 288 of the 1990 Act. In that event, procedures similar to those applicable to judicial review would apply. Application for leave to appeal would have to be lodged within 6 weeks of the decision of the Planning Inspectorate of which complaint is made and permission of the Planning Court would have to be granted before the appeal could proceed.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Given these routes of appeal, it is common ground that judicial review of Sutton's decision would be unavailable, even if the time limits, under CPR 54, had not expired. Even in the absence of Lawlor's appeal, the fact of the section 78 avenue of appeal would, ordinarily, rule out judicial review, by reason of Lawlor's failure to exhaust its remedies. It is, apparently, possible that in some cases, where the public law point at issue is a point of pure law and where the process of appeal to the Planning Inspectorate has not been commenced, that the Administrative, or Planning, Court, will entertain judicial review, notwithstanding the availability of the section 78 route of appeal. That, however, is not this case.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In this case, T&P seek to justify its decision to bring these Part 8 proceedings, alongside Lawlor's section 78 appeal and without conforming to the usual procedures for challenging a public law decision, on two principal grounds; firstly, that developments in case law, since O'Reilly v Mackman, have had the effect of diluting the exclusivity principle, such that there is no longer to be found any bright line between private law and public law rights and such that, in this case, there is a sufficient private law interest to warrant the approach that T&P has taken; secondly, that, in the circumstances of this case, the public importance, in the determination of the issue of construction of the Article 4 Direction and the exception, warrant that approach.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \" In regard to the latter, Mr Tucker QC, for T&P, explained that his concern, or one of them, was that Lawlor's success, on appeal to the Planning Inspectorate would not provide a definitive and binding ruling, whether in respect of T&P, or in respect of other persons having an interest in the determination of the question of construction. He postulated, in particular, the situation where Lawlor won its appeal, but where Sutton elected not to appeal. He submitted that, in that situation, there being no binding legal ruling from the court, it would be open to Sutton to maintain its current position, on construction, in respect both of what he termed a re-planning by T&P (meaning a new application for prior approval in relation to a different development scheme for the Property than the one which, if the current appeal is allowed, would have prior approval) and  any applications for prior approval by other developers, seeking to develop properties in the area embraced by the Article 4 Direction and relying upon the existence of lapsed prior approvals as perpetuating their right to permitted development, under the 2015 Order.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In both instances, Mr Tucker acknowledged that the declaration sought in the current proceedings would not, of itself, provide that binding authority (the declaration being limited to the existence of permitted development rights in relation to the particular development in respect of which Sutton has refused prior approval). He submitted, however, I think correctly, that the reasoning, or ratio decidendi, leading to the declaration he sought, would bind the Planning Inspectorate, as an inferior tribunal, and, thus, preclude Sutton from any attempted re-argument of the point of construction.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Tucker accepted that, in certain circumstances, it would be necessary, or appropriate, to stay the current proceedings. Those circumstances would arise if T&P lost its planning appeal but, then, appealed to the Planning Court, under section 288 of the 1990 Act, or if, T&P, having succeeded in the planning appeal, Sutton then actively pursued an appeal under that section of the 1990 Act.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'I am not persuaded that there is any sufficient private law interest raised in this case to justify the use of these Part 8 proceedings. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Lord Diplock, in O'Reilly v Mackman, contemplated, at page 285E to G, that exceptions to the exclusivity principle would, or might, arise, particularly where the challenged public law decision arose collaterally to an alleged infringement of private law rights, and that further exceptions might arise as case law developed. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"There have, undoubtedly, been such developments and, as foreshadowed by Lord Diplock and, as explained by Carnwath LJ, as he then was, in Trim v North Dorset CC [2010] EWCA Civ 1446, at paragraphs 21 to 23, it is primarily in the area where private and public law rights overlap and where private law disputes involve public bodies that exceptions to the exclusivity principle have been created and where (quoting Wade & Forsyth, Administrative Law 10th Edition, pages 570 to 581, and De Smith's Judicial Review, 6th Edition, paragraph 3-097) there have been  'signs of liberality' and of an abatement in the 'rigours of exclusivity' and a perception of the need for a 'new approach'. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'However, as set out, in Trim, at paragraph 23, there is nothing in these developments to undermine, or challenge, the core principle that purely public acts should be challenged, only, in public law proceedings.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In my view, this is just such a case. As already stated, this is not a case where T&P relies upon any private law rights, in its challenge to the construction that Sutton has placed upon the Article 4 Direction and the exception contained within that Direction. The issue raised is purely as to the true construction, meaning and effect of the Article 4 Direction and that Direction, having the effect, as it does, of reducing, or removing, to an extent dependent upon its true construction and effect, general permitted development rights available to any landowner, or developer, interested in the land the subject of the Direction, is, as again already stated, quintessentially a matter of public law. T&P can point to no factor special to it, as opposed to any other putative developer, having the benefit of a lapsed prior approval, such as to render Sutton's construction of the Direction and its, consequent, refusal of prior approval for T&P's proposed development any different in the case of T&P than it would have been for any other developer in the same position.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The fact, that Sutton\\'s construction of the Direction and its consequent refusal of prior approval for T&P\\'s development has the effect of preventing that development and, thereby, impairing T&P\\'s use of the Property, does not, for that reason, provide T&P with a private law interest in that construction and refusal, or preclude the question of the meaning and effect of the Direction from retaining its public law status. As set out, in paragraph 27 of Trim, \\'[p]ublic action does not lose its \"public\" character merely because it involves, as most public action does, interference with private rights and freedoms. It is only where there is an overlap with private law principles ... that procedural exclusivity may become difficult to maintain\\'.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In this case, no such principles are in play, no relevant private interest is engaged, the issue as to the true construction and effect of the Direction remains a purely public law question and, for that reason, the exclusivity principle applies.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"That view and the corresponding conclusion that this Part 8 Claim is a misuse of the process and that the proper approach has been that taken by Lawlor, by way of its section 78 appeal, is, only, confirmed by a consideration of T&P's submission based upon the alleged public importance of securing a determination of the proper meaning, effect and construction of the Article 4 Direction and the exception.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Tucker, in emphasising the public significance of the issue for determination in this case, drew attention to the fact that both in Trim and in another case relied upon by Sutton, Cash v Wokingham BC [2014] EWHC 3748 (Admin) (both cases where Part 8 Claims were struck out for abuse of process) the  declaratory relief sought related in the one case to a local authority breach of condition notice relating to a retrospective planning permission and in the other case to enforcement notices served by the relevant local authority. The point he sought to make was that, in both instances, because the notices in question related to enforcement, they, in a sense, raised private issues, as between the relevant local authority and the particular claimants and did not, therefore, have the public significance of the declarations sought in this case.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"With all respect to Mr Tucker, it seems to me that the point works against him. In Richards v Worcestershire County Council [2017] EWCA Civ 1998, Rupert Jackson LJ, having reviewed the relevant case law, in a case where Part 7 proceedings had been brought against the defendant council and where that council had applied to strike out, pursuant to the exclusivity principle, concluded, at paragraph 65, that 'the exclusivity principle applies where the claimant is challenging a public law decision or action and \\x85 his claim affects the public generally'. That, as it seems to me, is, precisely, the case that T&P put forward and, precisely, the reason why this case falls, squarely, within the exclusivity principle and should not, therefore, proceed under Part 8. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In light of the foregoing, I can deal relatively shortly with Sutton's alternative argument that the doubling up of these proceedings with the section 78 appeal is, in itself, an abuse of process.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In my view, it is.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"Mr Tucker has explained, as set out in paragraph 30 of this judgment that the fundamental reason for the doubling up of these proceedings with the section 78 planning appeal is, paradoxically, to protect T&P, or Lawlor, or other putative developers, from the situation which might arise if Lawlor were successful in the planning appeal, if Sutton, then, elected not to take the matter to the Planning Court, under section 288 of the 1990 Act, and if Sutton, whether as against T&P, in respect of a new prior approval application, or as against some other potential developer of land within the area included within the Article 4 Direction and, like T&P, having the benefit of a lapsed prior approval, elected  to refuse prior approval on the same basis and on the application of the same construction of the Direction as, in this hypothesis, would have already been rejected by the planning inspectorate, in respect of Lawlor's current appeal. He argued, additionally, that, in the somewhat unlikely event that the court's determination, in these proceedings, was achieved before the planning Inspectorate issued its decision, then the court's decision would be determinative of the planning appeal.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In regard to the latter point. It cannot, in my judgment, be other than abusive, in circumstances where a properly constituted appeal tribunal is seised of an appeal, to bring parallel proceedings in respect of the very same point. The overriding objective, in the Civil Procedure Rules, applicable across both private and public law cases and to which reference was made by Lord Woolf, in the context of the exclusivity principle, in Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Humberside [2000] 1 WLR 1988, attaches considerable weight, as currently in force, to the proportionate use of the resources of the court. It cannot, in my view, be a proportionate use of those resources to bring parallel proceedings in the way that T&P has done in this case, particularly where the tribunal proceedings are, as it seems to me that they are, the appropriate proceedings to deal with the public law issue raised in this case and where these current proceedings offend, as already explained, against the exclusivity principle.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In regard to the paradoxical contention that these parallel proceedings provide a protection for T&P and/or other developers, in the event that Lawlor's planning appeal succeeds and is not appealed further, I have no doubt but that the continuation of these proceedings for that purpose would be abusive.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' Putting aside what, to a non-planner, seems the gross improbability that Sutton would behave as postulated by Mr Tucker, it is, in my view, plainly abusive for proceedings to continue, for the purpose of affording this supposed  protection when, in the circumstances postulated by Mr Tucker, Lawlor would have, by its success on the section 78 appeal, procured prior approval for its proposed development, on the footing that that development constituted permitted development, under the 2015 Order, and when, therefore, the Part 8 proceedings, if continued, would continue for the purpose of seeking a declaration to exactly the same effect as the relief already obtained. Any continuation of the proceedings, in those circumstances and after the relevant relief had already been obtained would, as between the parties, be wholly academic, a waste of court resources and an abuse.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",

The respondent, Mr William Corbett, is a parish councillor on the St Mawgan in Pydar Parish Council and leader of its Planning Group.

The site is in the countryside, not in the Cornwall and Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, but in the Watergate and Lanherne Area of Great Landscape Value.

Taken together, Mr Bowes submitted, those policies were \"clearly and unambiguously\" against the proposal \\x96 because of the acknowledged breach of Policy 14. That policy had been deliberately saved by the Secretary of State. And it is in unequivocal terms: proposed development \"will not be permitted\" if it \"would cause harm to the landscape, features and characteristics\" of an Area of Great Landscape Value. The officer concluded that there would be such harm. In those circumstances, as the judge recognized, Policy 14 had to be seen as a policy whose effect, \"by necessary implication\", was to override \\x96 or at least to limit or qualify \\x96 Policy 5.

By contrast, in Chichester District Council, the provisions of the local plan required no such inference, because the policies of central relevance to the proposed housing development were explicit.

That support is not subject to any proviso, stated either in the policy itself or in its supporting text, as to the effects a particular development might have on an area of protected landscape \\x96 including Areas of Great Landscape Value.

It says what proposals for development in an Area of Great Landscape Value \"should\" do \\x96 that they \"should maintain the character and distinctive landscape qualities of such areas\". Policy 14 is in negative terms. It says simply that \"[developments] will not be permitted that would cause harm to the landscape, features and characteristics of Areas of Great Landscape Value\".

Nor is the policy qualified by any reference to the nature or degree of harm likely to be caused. And it says nothing about development expressly supported in other policies of the plan. None of this means, however, that the policy is intended to operate to the exclusion of those policies, such as Policy 5 of the Cornwall Local Plan, in which the benefits of particular forms of development are emphasized, or that it renders those other policies irrelevant to the question of whether a particular proposal accords with the development plan as a whole.

That understanding of Policy 14 would not only be an unrealistic and unnecessary constraint on the decision-maker\\'s performance of the section 38(6) duty; it is also incorrect as a matter of construction. None of the policies, including Policy 14, is framed in terms that give it dominance over the others. No order of priority, setting one policy higher than another, or implying that one overrides or displaces any other, is indicated either in the policies themselves or in the accompanying text. Nowhere is it stated, or implied, that any conflict with Policy 14 will necessarily lead to a proposal being found to be not in accordance with the development plan as a whole, or to a refusal of planning permission. And in my view there can be no justification for reading words into Policy 14 that are not there, effectively excluding from the matrix of development plan policy relevant to proposals for \"tourism facilities \\x85 and accommodation\" the very policy that specifically relates to development of this kind \\x96 Policy 5; denying that policy its proper place in the performance by the council of its duty under section 38(6); and nullifying the support that such proposals are given by the plan. \\r',\n",

       "  'I do not accept that argument. Once again one must remember that the development plan has to be read sensibly as a whole. Policy 5 and Policy 7 have quite different objectives. However, as Mr Findlay submitted, on the construction of Policy 7 urged upon us by Mr Bowes, it is hard to conceive of any \"tourism \\x85 accommodation\" in the countryside of the kind supported by Policy 5 that would escape the restriction in Policy 7, though the latter says nothing about such development. This seems an unjustified reading of the two policies. And in my view it is incorrect. The policies may not be mutually exclusive in the forms of accommodation to which they potentially apply. But they can be read, and should be, without introducing unintended contradiction. And I think that in this case the council\\'s committee, in the light of the officer\\'s advice, was entitled to deal with Mr Tavener\\'s proposal as \"tourism \\x85 accommodation\" of the kind that earns the support of Policy 5, and not also within the reach of Policy 7. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Mr Bowes did not contend that the proposed development lay outside the scope of Policy 5 \\x96 and, in particular, the provision expressing support for \"new, high quality sustainable tourism \\x85 accommodation\" so long as it satisfies the requirements relating to \"scale\", \"accessibility\" and \"benefits\". That would not have been a realistic submission. The proposal, as described by the officer under the heading \"Principle of Development\" in paragraphs 27 to 36 of her report, undoubtedly fell within Policy 5, and was supported by it.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Was the officer wrong to conclude that the proposal did not have to be considered under Policy 7 in addition to Policy 5? In my view, at least in the circumstances of this case, she was not. This much is clear from what she said when dealing with the \"Principle of Development\" in paragraph 27 of her report, where she noted that the \"application site is located within the countryside where open market housing would not be supported by policy\". She can only have been referring there to the restriction on such development in Policy 7. Mr Bowes did not suggest otherwise. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'I do not think the officer misinterpreted Policy 7. She made it plain that she was conscious of the restriction it contains on the development of \"housing\" in the countryside. She did not suggest that any of the exceptions might apply here. Nor did she suggest that the concept of \"new homes\" or \"dwellings\" in the policy was to be taken more narrowly than \"[use] as a dwellinghouse (whether or not as a sole or main residence)\", within Class C3 of the Use Classes Order. Her understanding of the policy was not at odds with the broad conception of such use in the relevant authorities. She did not advise the members that the development of \"holiday accommodation\" could never, in any circumstances, be regarded as \"housing\" within the ambit of the policy.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'She did, however, confront the crucial question, which was whether in the particular circumstances of this case, where the proposed development was an extension to an existing holiday park and met the relevant criteria in Policy 5, and despite the condition she recommended to control the occupancy of the proposed \"holiday accommodation\", the proposal ought nevertheless to be regarded as one to which Policy 7 should be applied.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'She was aware of what the inspector had said in his decision letter on the Lower Sticker appeal. Not only had that decision had been referred to in the parish council\\'s objection, which she quoted in her report; it had also been discussed in correspondence between her and Mr Corbett in December 2017. In her email to Mr Corbett dated 4 December 2017, she contrasted the development at Lower Sticker with that proposed by Mr Tavener. On the facts there, as she pointed out, the inspector had concluded that the development against which the council had enforced, which was not an extension of an existing tourism facility, found no support in Policy 5, but ought to be assessed against Policy 7 as \"housing in the countryside\". The inspector said (in paragraph 11 of his decision letter): \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '  \"11. LP Policy 5 supports the development of new tourism facilities through the provision of new, high quality sustainable accommodation which is of an appropriate scale to its location and is accessible by a range of transport nodes. As the site is not within a settlement that provides for the day-to-day facilities the development does not accord with LP Policy 5 and paragraphs 28 and 55 of [the NPPF]. No analysis of the contribution the development makes to the local economy or how it augments local tourist needs have been submitted, other than the appellants stating that caravan lettings support their income and that the caravans provide a special low-key type of holiday.\"',\n",
       "  '\\tMr Tavener\\'s proposal for the extension of the Sun Valley Holiday Park was significantly different. As the officer went on to say in her email, it \"would expand the holiday park\". She quoted the relevant provision in Policy 5 supporting the \"\\x85 the enhancement of existing or provision of new, high quality sustainable tourism facilities \\x85\". And she confirmed that Mr Tavener\\'s proposal would be assessed against the considerations in that policy.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\\tWhen she prepared her report for the committee meeting in February 2018, that is what she did. Applying Policy 5, she was satisfied that in this case the proposal was squarely within the policy, complied with it, and would bring about benefits of the kind it sought, contributing to the local economy and meeting a local need for tourism facilities. Her description of it (in paragraph 35 of the report) as an \"expansion of an existing sustainable tourism facility, which contains existing facilities for patrons of [the Sun Valley Holiday Park] in an appropriate location where existing needs are not being met\" is not criticized. Nor is her conclusion (in the same paragraph), that the development \"would support economic growth and safeguard/create jobs in this rural area\", and so \"comply with paragraph 28 of the NPPF and policy 5 of the CLP\". \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\\tThese were matters of planning judgment, which, in my view, the officer, and the members, exercised lawfully. As the officer made clear, her conclusions assumed a condition restricting the use of the proposed \"holiday units\" to their use as such, thus ensuring they would remain within Policy 5 (paragraph 27 of the report). The condition stipulates that the pitches are to be \"used as holiday accommodation only and shall not be occupied as a person\\'s sole or main place of residence\". And the reason for its imposition \\x96 \"[to] accord with development plan housing policies under which permanent residential accommodation would not normally be permitted on the site and the accommodation \\x85 is unsuitable for continuous occupation and in accordance with the aims and intentions of paragraphs 28 and 55 of [the NPPF]\" \\x96 shows the council\\'s intent that the development will remain, as proposed, \"tourism \\x85 accommodation\" within Policy 5, and not become \"[housing] in the countryside\" contrary to Policy 7. \\r',\n",

       "  'Finally, I think it is worth recalling what Baroness Hale of Richmond said about decision-making by local planning authorities in R. (on the application of Morge) v Hampshire County Council [2011] UKSC 2; [2011] 1 WLR 268 (at paragraph 36): that \"in this country planning decisions are taken by democratically elected councillors, responsible to, and sensitive to the concerns of, their local communities\", who \"go about their decision-making in a different way from courts\", aided by \"professional advisers who investigate and report to them\", and it is \"their job, and not the court\\'s, to weigh the competing public and private interests involved\".\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'I think it can fairly be said that, in undertaking that role, the professional officers of a local planning authority, and members who sit regularly on a planning committee, will not often be shown to have misinterpreted the policies of its development plan. This is not to cast any doubt on the basic principle that the interpretation of planning policy is ultimately a matter of law for the court, not the policy-making authority, nor is it to overlook Lord Reed\\'s warning in Tesco v Dundee City Council (at paragraph 19) that local planning authorities \"cannot make the development plan mean whatever they would like it to mean\" \\x96 though he did not suggest it was likely that many authorities would think they could. When planning decisions are made, the policies of the local plan must always be properly understood and lawfully applied. Errors of law will sometimes be made, and the court will act when they are.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"In this case, in my view, no such error occurred. The council did not misconceive the relevant policies of its plan, and did not apply them unlawfully. Its decision was clearly explained in the officer's report. The grant of planning permission should not have been quashed.\\r\",\n",

He concluded that whilst the rules of the Supreme Court then in force required that the notice of originating motion had to be entered at the Crown Office and served on the appropriate Minister within the six week time limit, the \"application to the High Court\" required by the statute was the entry of the notice of motion at the Crown Office.  Accordingly, in a case where the application was made within the statutory time limit, but the service was not within the period specified by the rules of court, the Court had power to extend the time for service. \\r',\n",

In Summers, Morris J made it clear that the question whether the court had power to extend time for service depended on whether all steps, including service, must take place to constitute an application; or whether the application was made by the entry of the notice of motion in the Crown Office, and the time for service was prescribed by the rules of court. He explained why he considered the latter analysis to be correct:\\r',\n",

       "  '\"In my view, the application to the High Court is indicated by RSC O.55B, r 71 to be the originating notice of motion which was entered within the six weeks.

He did not propose to depart from it.',\n",
       "  'Both Schiemann J and Morris J expressly rejected the proposition that the application to the High Court included both the entering of the originating notice of motion and the service on any person who had to be served with it. The key question that I have been asked to decide is whether the position that has been established for many years as to what is required to \"make an application\" has changed in the light of the provisions of the CPR and the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Croke v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2019] EWCA Civ 54 (\"Croke\").\\r',\n",

PD 8C para. 2.2 requires that application to be made within the Part 8 Claim Form, which para. 2.1 stipulates as the means by which an application for planning statutory review is to be made to the Court.\\r',\n",

The former is dealt with in PD8C para 2.1 and CPR 54.5(5), the latter in PD8C para.4, which uses slightly different language from para.2.1. Para.2.1 states that a Part 8 claim form \"must be used and must be filed at the Administrative Court within the time limited by the statutory provisions set out in paragraph 1.1\". That suggests that the time limit in the statute relates to the act of filing the claim form with the Court. This is consistent with the position in respect of any other claim form, whether issued under Part 7 or Part 8; it is generally the action prescribed by the rules for initiating the proceedings before the Court that stops time running for limitation purposes.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Para.4.4, however, states that \"the claim form must be served within the time limited by the relevant enactment for making a claim for planning statutory review\". It is implicit in that phrase that service is not the same thing as making a claim, as the statute is solely concerned with the time limit for making the claim. Thus, just as with previous rules of court, on the face of it service of the claim form forms no part of the \"making of the application\" for permission. That is hardly surprising, because the application is made to the Court. The time for service of the claim form is prescribed by the Practice Direction and not by the statute itself, and there is power to extend time for service. The next question is whether the Court of Appeal has said anything that constrains me to interpret the provisions of s.288 and the current rules of court differently.   \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Croke was not a case about service of a claim form. The decisions in Summers and Mendip are not referred to in the judgment, as one might have expected if the Court of Appeal had decided to overturn them. The case was solely concerned with the question whether the court had jurisdiction to extend the statutory time limit for making the application. Mr Croke had made two unsuccessful attempts to lodge the application with the court, one before the expiry of the six-week time limit, and one the day after.  \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' Lindblom LJ, who delivered the leading judgment, referred to the time limit in s.288(4B) and to numerous authorities in which the six-week period has been treated as immutable. He referred to PD8C and PD54E and to the discretion of the court to enable the correction of defects in the claim form or amendments to be made to it, so long as it was issued and filed in time. He also referred to the two accepted exceptions to the rule, namely:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  ' (i) where the court office was closed on the last day of the six-week period, see Pritam Kaur v S. Russell & Sons Ltd [1973] 1 QB 336 and ',\n",
       "  '(ii) the exceptional case where the denial of an extension would infringe Art 6 ECHR. ',\n",
       "  'He said that apart from those exceptions, there was no room for the exercise of judicial discretion. Parliament had provided a strict time limit of six weeks for the making of an application under s.288. Subsection (4B) does not admit any exception to the absolute time limit it lays down. That time limit is precise, unambiguous and unqualified and the statutory language is mandatory. He concluded that any extension of the Kaur principle would create uncertainty and inconsistency and act against access to justice for all parties to a planning dispute.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'There is nothing in the judgment in Croke that conflicts with the approach in Mendip and Summers. Indeed, it is clear from those judgments that Morris J and Schiemann J both considered that the time-limit for making the application (by entry of the motion in the Crown Office) was prescribed by Parliament and could not be extended. The power to extend time for service derived solely from the fact that the time for service was set by the rules of court, not the statute, albeit that the rules prescribed the same time for service as for making the application.\\r',\n",

It would have been, if One Kemble Street had been the correct address for service on the Minister, but that was no longer the case, and that address is no longer a Government building. There is an application before me for an extension of time, supported by evidence from the Claimant's solicitor Mr Jonathan Griffiths, who explained the factual background to which I have already referred. I am satisfied that the application was made promptly.\\r\",\n",

The intention is plainly to achieve certainty and finality, so that all parties to a planning dispute know exactly where they stand at the end of the six-week period. The provisions of CPR 7.6, the guidance in Hashtroodi v Hancock [2004] EWCA Civ 652, [2004] 1 WLR 3206 and, by analogy, the considerations in applications for relief from sanctions under CPR 3.9 are relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion. \\r\",\n",

They acted reasonably in relying on the address for service that was stated in the hard copy of the White Book. The supplement, which was stated to be up to date to 1 October 2019, did not flag up the change of address even though the GLD had moved on 11 September. \\r\",\n",

Had the letter been addressed to 102 Petty France in the first place, that delay would not have counted in any event, as all relevant steps would have been completed on 19 November when the claim form was posted. The interested party, the developer who is probably the person most affected by the challenge to the grant of planning permission, has made no complaint, and has filed summary grounds of resistance on the merits. Bearing in mind the overriding objective, it seems to me that the justice of the case requires the short extension of time to be granted.

The principles upon which such decisions may be challenged are well established. The interpretation of planning policy is ultimately a matter of law for the Court to determine, but its application is a matter of planning judgment with which the Court will only interfere in limited circumstances, essentially where the decision-maker has fallen into \"Wednesbury\" error (see Hopkins Homes Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2017] 1 WLR 1865 at [26].)

One of them must be wrong, and on the face of it there is at least a respectable argument that it was the approach taken in this case. For present purposes all I need to decide is whether the argument has a real prospect of success..\\r',\n",

I understand that to be a reference to the summary of the law set out succinctly in paragraphs 21-22 of that judgment. Mr Garvey submitted that the judgment in Gladman turned on the particular policies relevant to that matter and has no relevance here. If and to the extent that the Claimant seeks to draw any parallels between the way in which the relevant local policies were interpreted in Gladman and the approach advocated in the present case, I agree. Indeed, in Chichester DC v Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government [2019] EWCA Civ 1640 at [32] Lindblom LJ said that the circumstances in which the basic principles that he adumbrated are applied will vary widely. He sounded a note of caution about reading the analysis in one case across into another because, as he put it, \"the policies of each plan are unique, crafted for the area or neighbourhood to which they relate, not to fit some wider pattern or prescription.\"\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'However, to the extent that the Claimant relies upon paragraphs 21 and 22 of Gladman as a useful recent summary of the relevant principles of interpretation, the primacy to be afforded to the development plan and the obligation on the decision maker to \"identify and understand the relevant policies, and\\x85 establish whether or not the proposal accords with the plan, read as a whole\" it is entitled to do so. To the extent that Ground 1 is a complaint that the Inspector failed to consider the Plan as a whole, but instead treated Policy H1 or various aspects of it in isolation, in consequence reaching an incorrect interpretation, it is unexceptionable. I consider that there is more than sufficient evidence that the Inspector misinterpreted the relevant policies to surmount the threshold for permission in the present case. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Whilst at first sight, Ground 2 appears to me to be more a statement of the consequences of the alleged misinterpretation of Policy H1 than an independent ground of review, it is put by Mr Jones on the basis that no reasonable Inspector applying the correct principles of interpretation could have reached that conclusion, because it undermines the Development Plan. I consider that the Claimant should be entitled to argue that point even if it adds little or nothing to Ground 1 or is more properly to be viewed as a facet of that Ground.\\r',\n",

       "  'On 29 January 2020 the Admiralty Court made an order at the request of the Claimant in this action, Qatar National Bank, that the \"Super Yacht\" FORCE INDIA be sold. The Admiralty Marshal instructed his broker to sell FORCE INDIA and bids were to be received by 10 March 2020. On that very day the Claimants applied to the Court for an order setting aside the order for sale. The Court declined to do so but suspended the sale to enable a proper hearing to take place on notice to the interested parties. In so doing the court followed the course adopted by Hewson J. in The Acrux [1961] 1 Lloyd\\'s Reports 471. In order to protect the position of the Marshal, his brokers, another claimant with a statutory right of action in rem and the claimants in another action who had obtained a Worldwide Freezing Order which affected FORCE INDIA, the order for sale was only suspended on terms that certain undertakings were given. On 20 March 2020 the Court considered the adjourned application with the benefit of submissions from the interested parties and further evidence. That hearing took place by telephone as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The Court decided to set aside the order for sale. In view of the unusual nature of the application the Court indicated that its reasons would be a given at a later date. These are the Court\\'s reasons. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Court is particularly grateful to Charles Berthillon, a director of Cannes Islands, for his second witness statement dated 20 March 2020 which was prepared urgently in order to provide the Court with important evidence regarding the genesis of the application to set aside the order for sale.\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The background',\n",
       "  \"The Claimant had a mortgage on FORCE INDIA and on 29 January 2020 had obtained judgment against the yacht in respect of the sums secured by that mortgage. Unusually, the mortgage had not been granted as security for a loan to the owner of the yacht to enable him to purchase the yacht. A related company known as Gizmo had borrowed some \\x8027 million in 2008 to finance the acquisition of a company which owned a property in Sainte Marguerite off the coast of France. The mortgage on the yacht was later granted as additional security for that loan. The circumstances in which the mortgage was granted were described in the Court's judgment given on 29 January 2020 at paragraph 3; see [2020] EWHC 103 (Admlty). \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'On 27 December 2019, prior to the Claimant obtaining judgment in rem against the yacht, Gizmo and Cannes Islands SAS, a subsidiary of a Swiss company in the luxury real estate business, had entered into a memorandum of understanding by which Cannes Islands would purchase the shares in Le Grand Jardin, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gizmo which owned the property in Sainte Marguerite. Cannes Islands has no links with the Owners of FORCE INDIA or with Dr. Mallya, who is said (which allegation is denied) to be the beneficial owner of FORCE INDIA. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Le Grand Jardin had been placed under judicial receivership by the Commercial Court in Cannes on 5 February 2019 and the memorandum of understanding required Cannes Islands and Gizmo to obtain that court\\'s approval to the \"continuation plan\" for Le Grand Jardin. \\r',\n",

       "  'The need for an order setting aside the order for sale',\n",
       "  \"On 4 February 2020, that is after the Admiralty Court had ordered the sale of FORCE INDIA, the Commercial Court in Cannes considered the continuation plan. The court expressed reservations that the plan did not sufficiently guarantee the repayment of Le Grand Jardin's liabilities, in particular those owed to the Claimant. As a result of the court's reservations a transaction, the Assignment Agreement, was entered into between Cannes Islands and the Claimant on 6 March 2020. A sum of Euros 17.5 million was to be paid to the Claimant in return for an assignment of contracts and receivables, including an assignment of the charge on the French property and of the mortgage on the yacht. This arrangement was to assure the Cannes Commercial Court that Le Grand Jardin's liabilities would be repaid. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Claimant was obliged by clause 7.3 of the Assignment Agreement to apply to the English Admiralty Court for an order revoking the order for the sale of FORCE INDIA \"prior to 10 March 2020 at noon\". The sum of Euros 17.5 million was paid on 10 March 2020 and both Cannes Islands and the Defendant provided letters dated 9 March 2020 confirming their consent to the \"cancellation\" of the judicial sale of FORCE INDIA. Hence it was that the Claimant made the application to this Court on the morning of 10 March 2020. \\r',\n",

       "  'The reason for rescinding the order for sale',\n",
       "  'The reason is simple. In circumstances where the sum secured by the mortgage has in effect been paid by a third party the judicial sale of the vessel is no longer required.

       "  \"The court's concerns\",\n",
       "  \"Sales by the Admiralty Marshal of vessels which have been arrested in an Admiralty action in rem are the means by which, failing the provision of alternative security, claims in rem are enforced. Sales by the Marshal are free of pre-existing maritime liens, statutory rights of action in rem or other encumbrances. In order to ensure that the market price is achieved the vessel's value is appraised prior to sale. The Marshal cannot sell for less than the appraised value without the permission of the court. These features of an Admiralty sale are well known to the market. If it became the practice for orders for sale to be set aside those willing to incur the time and expense involved in making a bid for a vessel ordered to be sold may feel disinclined to do so. That might lead to vessels being sold for less than their market value and might tarnish the reputation of the Court. In the long term the service provided by the Admiralty Court to the maritime community would or might be damaged. \\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'These concerns suggest that the court should be reluctant to set aside a sale, particularly when the application is made as late as the application in this case was made. In his witness statement the Marshal has stated that, according to his broker, Paul Wilcox of Kellocks, around 20 potential bidders had carried out inspections and investigations during the sale period and that if it became widespread knowledge that parties can stop a sale process it will make interested parties \"more cautious about bidding for vessels being sold through the court\\'s process\".\\r',\n",

       "  'The setting aside of sales should certainly not become a practice. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'However, there are very few instances of such applications being made. The only reported instance appears to be The Acrux in 1961. That such applications are rare is apparent from the witness statement of the Marshal in which he said that he had been informed by his broker, Mr. Paul Wilcox of Kellocks, that in his 40 year association with court sales he had never known such an application being made to halt a sale at such a late stage. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The present case',\n",
       "  'It is to be expected that applications for an order setting aside a sale will be rare because in the usual case where it has been necessary for the claimant to seek an order for sale that will because the sale of the vessel is the only means by which his claim can be satisfied. It must be a rare case when, as in the present case, an independent third party is prepared, in effect, to discharge the judgment debt and so render the sale of the vessel unnecessary. Indeed, in the present case that has only come about because the asset which the third party wished to acquire, the French property, was charged with a debt which also secured in part by the mortgage on the yacht. Thus when the loan secured by the charge on the property was paid, the smaller sum secured by the mortgage on the yacht was also discharged. These are unusual circumstances, at least in the context of sales by the Admiralty Court. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  \"I was therefore persuaded that the need to set aside the order for sale in the present case was brought about by unusual and perhaps exceptional circumstances. So long as this is understood by the market there should not be any damage to the reputation of the Court or to its ability in future cases to achieve a vessel's market value when an order for sale is made.\\r\",\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'For these reasons I concluded that it was appropriate to set aside the order for sale and to release the yacht from arrest.   \\r',\n",

The Marshal informed the parties that the broker has claimed £5,250 in respect of the cost and expense of marketing and selling the yacht. Ordinarily the broker would recover a commission on the court sale but that will not happen now that the order for sale has been set aside. In that regard counsel for the Claimant (and counsel for Cannes Islands who indemnify the Claimant) informed the court that they accepted that the Marshal could pay those costs and expenses and recover them from the Claimant.  \\r\",\n",

Counsel for the State Bank sought an undertaking from the Defendant that if the yacht were released from arrest it would not remove the yacht from the jurisdiction. Such an undertaking has been given but it was given by a Swiss director on behalf of the Defendant, a Maltese company. Counsel pointed out that there might be difficulties of enforcement if that undertaking were breached.

       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In a report dated 10 December 2018 (\"the IR\"), the Inspector recommended that planning permission and advertisement consent be granted.  \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Inspector identified the main issues at IR 12.9, as follows:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"(1) whether the proposal would provide reasonable living conditions for prospective occupiers in terms of air quality, amenity space, and accessibility, in particular; highway safety; and the effect of the proposal on the living conditions of nearby residents; (2) the building in its immediate context, in other words, its effect on the character and appearance of the local area; and (3) the building in its wider context, in other words, the effect of the proposal on the setting and thereby the significance of a range of designated heritage assets. That analysis needs to take place in the light of (4) any benefits the proposal might bring forward, including affordable housing, and whether any other impacts can be successfully mitigated. It is the balancing exercise that flows from (4) that allows a conclusion to be made about the overall quality of the design. Appeal B, and the impact of the proposed advertisements on amenity and public safety can be considered as part of (1), (2), (3) and (4) above.\" ',\n",
       "  'Under the heading \"Background\", the Inspector set out what he described as the context for the analysis of the effect of the building on the local and wider areas, at IR 12.31 to 12.37:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"12.31 \\tBefore dealing with the second issue, namely the effect of the building proposed on the local, and wider, areas, it is imperative that the context for that analysis is properly set out. ',\n",
       "  '12.32\\tThe appeal site is at the end of the Great West Corridor, or Golden Mile, and the Council has identified it as an entry point to the area, that ought to be marked with a landmark building, of high-quality, around 60m in height. The principle of a tall building on the site is therefore well established. A building of that height on the appeal site would be widely visible. ',\n",
       "  \"12.33\\tAlongside that, in line with the DRLP, and the HLP, the Council has wider ambitions for the Great West Corridor, and the adjoining area. Manifestations of those ambitions are already coming forward, notably the Brentford FC development. The Mayor's positive attitude to the proposals for the Citroen site, which at around 70m AOD, as I understand the situation, are significantly taller than what the Council thinks is appropriate for the 'landmark' on the appeal site, is also reflective of what might well be coming forward. \",\n",
       "  \"12.34\\tOn top of that, there is an implementable planning permission for a 60m tall building on the appeal site: the Citadel. Ms Weiss of the Skyline Campaign described it in evidence as terrible, in architectural terms, and it was criticised by others too. In my view, it fails to attain the level of architectural sophistication one ought to expect of a tall building, and it would be extremely unfortunate if it was progressed, especially when one takes into account the Council's current ambitions for the appeal site. \",\n",
       "  '12.35\\tIt was suggested that the Citadel can be discounted as a fall-back because it is not viable. It may well not be viable in a conventional sense but there are ways that it could be made viable through the addition of advertisements, for example. Moreover, in a London context, it is not unknown for buildings that are not viable at the onset of construction to be implemented in any event. It is clear that there has already been significant investment in the project, and there are strong reasons why it might come forward despite the economics - the Citadel would not require any payments under local, or Mayoral CIL, for example. It cannot be ruled out completely and the possibility of it coming forward is something that needs to be borne in mind. ',\n",
       "  '12.36\\tIn any event, whether the Citadel does or does not come forward is not the central point. There is a clear mandate in policy for a tall building on the site and it is reasonable to assume that one will manifest itself, in time. That building, alongside others in the Great West Corridor, under construction, or likely to come forward, will be visible from most of the areas the Council, and others, have expressed concern about. ',\n",
       "  '12.37\\tThe proposal at issue cannot reasonably be considered in isolation, therefore. Conclusions about impacts can be made, but they must be tempered in the light of what might come forward in the light of the Council\\'s plans for the site itself, the possibility, and I put it no higher than that, of the Citadel being implemented, and what is and will be coming forward in the wider area as part of the Council\\'s ambitions for the Great West Corridor.\" ',\n",
       "  'At IR 12.40 to 12.46, the Inspector was enthusiastic about the design of the building, with its \"highly sophisticated glazing module, articulated by fins of different colour\" which he considered would give the building \"a dynamism that would make the approach by road along the M4 a very exciting experience\". The Inspector acknowledged that the height of the building would be well above what the Council saw as appropriate, but disagreed, saying that he did not find the height inappropriate. He concluded that it was a \"quite brilliant response to the difficult problems presented by the immediate context of the Site\".\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'In considering the third main issue \\x96 the building in its wider context \\x96 the Inspector assessed its impact on the setting and significance of the heritage assets and found as follows:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'i)\\tIt would cause some harm to the setting and significance of the Strand-on-the-Green Conservation Area and the listed buildings on the river frontage (IR 12.58).  \\r',\n",

       "  'iv)\\tIt would cause a degree of harm to the setting, and significance of Kew Palace, and as a consequence, the Outstanding Universal Value (\"OUV\") of Kew Gardens, designated as a World Heritage Site, and its significance, and the significance of the Registered Park and Garden and the conservation areas (IR 12.118). ',\n",
       "  \"v)\\tIt would cause a degree of harm to the setting and significance of Kew Palace (a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument); the Orangery (a Grade I listed building); Cambridge Cottage (a Grade II listed building) and the Palm House (a Grade I listed building).  These buildings were an integral part of the iconic architectural legacy of the gardens and fundamental parts of the designed landscape.  The harm caused to their settings and significance would feed into harm to the OUV of the World Heritage Site, and its significance, together with the significance of the Registered Park and Garden, and the conservation area. To a degree, it would compromise a viewer's ability to appreciate its OUV, integrity, authenticity and significance (IR 12.132). \",\n",
       "  'The Inspector acknowledged, at IR 12.135, that many of these heritage assets were of the highest order of significance. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'Applying the National Planning Policy Framework (\"the Framework\"), the Inspector found that the harm was \"less than substantial\", and in accordance with paragraph 196, he weighed the harm against the public benefits of the proposal.  He assessed the benefits as follows: \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"12.151 The appellant points to a wide range of benefits that the proposal would bring forward. The first notable benefit of the scheme is the provision of 327 new homes, 116 of which would be affordable, which is in excess of the maximum viable level of affordable housing. ',\n",
       "  '12.152\\tThe Council sought to downplay this by pointing to the fact that they have well in excess of a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. They may well have in relation to their current OAN, as enshrined in the HLP, but that OAN is going to rise significantly as a result of the DRLP. Moreover, it is not correct to look at the Council area alone, given that London is one Housing Market Area, and a Housing Market Area with extreme pressures, especially in terms of affordability. In that context, the housing the scheme would bring forward, and the affordable housing especially, is a benefit that must attract significant weight in the planning balance. ',\n",
       "  \"12.153\\tThe proposal would bring forward a significant amount of high-quality workspace too. The Council, through their emerging policy, favour an office solution for the site and indeed, suggest that the Citadel would be a better prospect on the basis of the jobs it would bring to the area. However, they make the point that there is no guarantee that the new workspace in the proposal would bring new jobs; it might just feed the relocation of existing jobs. To my mind, the same argument could well be made about the Council's favoured use for the site. There are doubts too about whether this kind of solution would be viable, given the negative points made in relation to the viability of the Citadel. \",\n",
       "  '12.154\\tIn my view, the mix of high-quality new housing and workspace the scheme would bring forward is a much better solution for the site. I reach that conclusion in the light of Section 11 of the revised Framework and the encouragement therein to make effective use of land, and especially brownfield land. The mix of uses in the proposal certainly does that. ',\n",
       "  \"12.155\\tOf course, that does not come without environmental impacts, but the proposal, by reason of its sophisticated design, would bring a massive uplift to the local area, on a key gateway site deemed suitable for a 'marker', providing an active frontage, accessible ground and first floor uses, and environmental improvements to the area immediately surrounding the building. \",\n",
       "  '12.156\\tIt would act as a beacon, setting very high standards for other buildings coming forward in the Great West Corridor Opportunity Area. Viewed from further afield, it would cause some harm to the setting and thereby the significance of a range of designated heritage assets. However, the same would be true of the Citadel, or the 60m tall building the Council favours for the site. As I have set out, in these more distant views, the Chiswick Curve would create a legible hierarchy for the new stratum of development that will come forward in the Opportunity Area. I accept that others have a less favourable view about the qualities of the proposal but in my view, the provision of a work of architecture, of the quality proposed, represents a significant benefit. ',\n",
       "  ' \\x85 ',\n",
       "  '12.158\\tThere are other benefits in the proposal too. Like its predecessor, the revised Framework sets great store on building a strong, competitive economy. Paragraph 80 says that significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs, and wider opportunities for development. There can be no doubt that a project of the scale of the Chiswick Curve would create significant economic activity, and employment, in the construction phase, and beyond. ',\n",
       "  '12.159\\tIn my view, these benefits are of great magnitude and must carry a good deal of weight in the planning balance.\" ',\n",
       "  'Under the heading \"Final Conclusion\", the Inspector summarised the harm to heritage assets (at IR 12.160) and reminded himself that, by virtue of paragraph 193 of the Framework and section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the findings of harm must attract great weight or considerable importance and weight in the balancing exercise IR 12.161. \\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  'The Inspector found that the proposal was contrary to London Plan (\"LP\") Policies 7.8 and 7.10 (IR 12.161).  He then went on to conclude:\\r',\n",
       "  ' ',\n",
       "  '\"12.162 That cannot be the end of the matter though. If it was, then it is difficult to conceive of the Council and the Mayor\\'s ambitions for the Great West Corridor coming to fruition because the proposal coming forward would have similar impacts on designated heritage assets. It is fair to observe too that these LP policies do not contain the facility to balance benefits against harm, in the way the revised Framework does. ',\n",
       "  '12.163\\tNotwithstanding that great weight, or considerable importance and weight, must be attached to findings of harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, and especially those of the highest order, and the setting of listed buildings, and the strong presumption against any grant of planning permission in such circumstances, it is possible for other considerations to be even more weighty. ',\n",
       "  '12.164\\tIn London especially, decision-makers need to strike a balance between the protection of significance of designated heritage assets, and the OUV of WHSs, and the need to allow the surrounding land to change and evolve as it has for centuries. In this case, while I recognise that others, including the SoS may disagree, it is my view that the extensive public benefits the proposal would bring forward are more than sufficient to outweigh the less than substantial harm that would be caused to the significance of the various designated heritage assets. As a consequence, the proposal accords with HLP Policy CC4.   ',\n",
       "  '12.165\\tOn top of that, it is my view that notwithstanding the harmful impact it would have on the significance of designated heritage assets, viewed in the round, the design of the proposal is of the highest architectural quality. I do not subscribe to the view that a proposal that causes harm to the setting and thereby the significance of a designated heritage asset cannot represent good design. The proposal would bring a massive uplift to the area immediately around it, in accordance with LP Policies 7.1 and 7.4, and HLP Policies CC1 and CC2 and notwithstanding some harmful impacts that I regard as tolerable, it would make very efficient use of a brownfield site, in accordance with DRLP Policy D6. For the same reasons, there would be compliance with HLP Policies SC1, SC2, SC3, and SC4. There would be no harm caused to MOL as required by HLP Policy GB1 and the proposed advertisements would raise no significant issues in terms of amenity, or public safety, as required by HLP Policy CC5. On that overall basis, the proposal would accord with all the criteria set out in paragraph 127 of the revised Framework. ',\n",
       "  \"12.166\\tIn terms of its wider impacts, by reason of its height, and more particularly its design, the proposal would bring a legible hierarchy to the new layer of urban development that will be coming forward in the Great West Corridor. In that respect, it would perform much better than the Citadel, or the Council's favoured approach to the site. \",\n",
       "  '12.167\\tPut simply, the way this new layer of urban development will be perceived from, and in association with designated heritage assets, demands an approach that, like the proposal, has verve. I am afraid the Council\\'s more compromising approach, enshrined in emerging policy, would result in a layer of development with little sense of differentiation. I note what is said about the ability of using design to set a \\'marker\\' in the supporting text to Policy CC3, but this would be difficult to achieve when all tall buildings are expected to exhibit the highest standards of architectural design.\" ',\n",
       "  'At IR 12.170, the Inspector concluded that the proposal complied with the development plan, read as a whole, and that the scheme was in compliance with the Framework. He recommended that the appeals be allowed. \\r',\n",

At DL 24, he gave careful consideration to the Inspector\\'s assessment of the impact on heritage assets, at IR 12.47 \\x96 IR 12.150, which included both the impact of the Chiswick Curve and the impact of the Citadel and other development. He did not agree with the Inspector that the public benefits of the proposal outweighed the harm to the heritage assets (DL 25, DL 38, DL 39).  \\r',\n",

       "  'The Secretary of State was not required to assess whether the public benefits of the Citadel or other development would outweigh the harm to the heritage assets, as they were not the subject of the appeal, nor were they \"principal important controversial issues\".  Furthermore, future applications for planning permission have to be considered on their individual merits, and it is not the Secretary of State\\'s role to prescribe criteria to be met for a future application to succeed. But I consider it is obvious from the Secretary of State\\'s decision that a smaller building, which complied with LP Policies 7.7 and 7.10, would be more acceptable than the Chiswick Curve, in the light of his findings that the \"scale and massing of the proposal\" meant that it dominated the surrounding area (DL 28).  The Chiswick Curve was unacceptable because of the harm it would cause to the setting and significance of the heritage assets. The Secretary of State indicated that \"it could be possible for an alternative scheme with lesser impacts on designated heritage assets to also offer benefits of this type \\x85.[f]or example, the Citadel scheme, should it proceed, would offer benefits in terms of job provision\\x85\" (DL 36).  \\r',\n",

On my reading of paragraph 28, it can reasonably be inferred that, as the Secretary of State considered the proposal was too high and dominating for its location, he therefore did not agree with the Inspector\\'s view that it was a planning benefit for the Chiswick Curve to be significantly higher than the other buildings in the Great West Corridor, so as to head the hierarchy of high rise buildings (IR 12.44).  \\r',\n",

An observation or judgment made by an inspector when dealing with those issues cannot be elevated into a principal issue in its own right simply by taking a highly granular approach to the identification of the \"issues\".  Once the Secretary of State had rejected the Inspector\\'s enthusiastic assessment of the proposal as \"a brilliant response\" to its context (DL 28), and made his assessment of its flaws, he was not required to go on to spell out laboriously his rejection of the Inspector\\'s judgment on the legible hierarchy.  \\r',\n",

Hearings have now been concluded and the Panel will shortly be considering suggested changes and evidence submitted, with a view to submitting a report to the Mayor of London in September 2019. The Secretary of State considers that the emerging policies of most relevance to this case include DRLP policy SD1, seeking to fully realise the growth and regeneration potential of Opportunity Areas and Figure 2.10 which identifies the possible provision of 7,500 new homes and 14,000 new jobs in the Great West Corridor Opportunity Area. The DRLP retains the principle that London is a single housing market and increased the Borough of Hounslow\\'s housing target from 822 dwellings per annum to 2,182. DRLP Policy D6 seeks to optimise density and states that residential development that does not make the best use of the site should be refused. ',\n",
       "  '16. Paragraph 48 of the Framework states that decision makers may give weight to relevant policies in emerging plans according to: (1) the stage of preparation of the emerging plan; (2) the extent to which there are unresolved objections to relevant policies in the emerging plan; and (3) the degree of consistency of relevant policies to the policies in the Framework.

He also takes account of the fact that it is common ground between the parties that the Council can demonstrate a five year supply of housing land.  While he notes the prospect of the housing requirement increasing significantly as a result of the emerging Draft Replacement London Plan, given that objections are not yet fully resolved and its policies are still subject to change, the Secretary of State considers that the DRLP policies carry limited weight at present.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State attributes moderate weight to this benefit, in contrast to the Inspector\\'s finding of significant benefit.\"',\n",

This was an exercise of judgment on the part of the Secretary of State, not a misinterpretation of the Framework.   As Lord Carnwath made clear in Hopkins Homes v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2017] 1 WLR 1865, at [26], claimants should \"distinguish clearly between issues of interpretation of policy, appropriate for judicial analysis, and issues of judgment in the application of that policy; and not \\x85 elide the two\". It is well-established that the assessment of the weight to be given to material considerations, such as an emerging plan, can only be challenged on grounds of perversity (e.g. City of Edinburgh cited at paragraph 42 above).
