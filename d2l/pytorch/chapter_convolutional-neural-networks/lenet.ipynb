    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we made significant progress. We moved from the MLPs of the 1980s to the CNNs of the 1990s and early 2000s. The architectures proposed, e.g., in the form of LeNet-5 remain meaningful, even to this day. It is worth comparing the error rates on Fashion-MNIST achievable with LeNet-5 both to the very best possible with MLPs (:numref:`sec_mlp-implementation`) and those with significantly more advanced architectures such as ResNet (:numref:`sec_resnet`). LeNet is much more similar to the latter than to the former. One of the primary differences, as we shall see, is that greater amounts of computation afforded significantly more complex architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second difference is the relative ease with which we were able to implement LeNet. What used to be an engineering challenge worth months of C++ and assembly code, engineering to improve SN, an early Lisp based deep learning tool :cite:`Bottou.Le-Cun.1988`, and finally experimentation with models can now be accomplished in minutes. It is this incredible productivity boost that has democratized deep learning model development tremendously. In the next chapter we will follow down this rabbit to hole to see where it takes us.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's modernize LeNet. Implement and test the following changes:\n",
    "    1. Replace the average pooling with max-pooling.\n",
    "    1. Replace the softmax layer with ReLU.\n",
    "1. Try to change the size of the LeNet style network to improve its accuracy in addition to max-pooling and ReLU.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the convolution window size.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of output channels.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of convolution layers.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of fully connected layers.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the learning rates and other training details (e.g., initialization and number of epochs.)\n",
    "1. Try out the improved network on the original MNIST dataset.\n",
    "1. Display the activations of the first and second layer of LeNet for different inputs (e.g., sweaters and coats).\n",
    "1. What happens to the activations when you feed significantly different images into the network (e.g., cats, cars, or even random noise)?\n"
